Then there’s an average temperature of 27°C and pleasant trade winds. It’s got the lot. Can you ask for more? Well, Aruba has it in ladles. This small island has endless beaches, a world-famous diving scene, wild volcanic landscapes and picture-postcard pastel-coloured Dutch colonial architecture. Plus, it’s popular with flamingos, who know a good thing when they see it. 1. Arikok National Park If you like adventure, an excursion to Arikok National Park is a must. You’ll discover the rugged side of Aruba, with cacti, limestone rocks and almost-horizontal trees, which have been completely bent by the trade winds. An obligatory stop during any 4x4 tour of the park is the natural pool, known locally as ‘Conchi’. Surrounded by rocks, it has gin-clear ocean water. 2. Discover the island’s caves Another popular attraction in Aruba are its caves. The Fontein Cave has rock paintings drawn more than 1,000 years ago by the extinct aboriginal Caquetio people. While the Guadirikiri Cave is famed for its two chambers, which are lit by the sunlight that enters through holes in the roof. The dark part of the cave is home to hundreds of harmless bats. 3. Oranjestad, Aruba’s capital The island’s capital and largest town is an intriguing blend of styles. Old Oranjestad huddles around the harbour and boasts an Instagrammable collection of colourful colonial-era building. There are historic sites such as Fort Zoutman and the recently restored town hall. The newer, more international city boasts luxury boutiques, chic restaurants and exclusive nightlife venues. And a lovely little activity to try out is a trip on one of the open-sided retro trams that loop around the old town. 4. Water activities Snuba diving is one of the most popular water activities on the island. It’s a combination of snorkelling and diving – and, best of all, it doesn’t require heavy equipment. Accompanied by a guide, you’ll get to swim among the tropical fish. And if you prefer something more chilled out, go on a catamaran cruise and enjoy the views with a cocktail in hand. Or step aboard a submarine and see the coral reefs, old shipwrecks and schools of fish that surround Aruba. 5. The Old Dutch Mill A special attraction is the typical Dutch windmill at Palm Beach. It stands out in the tropical landscape and is a reminder of the island’s four centuries of links to the Netherlands. Originally located in Friesland, the mill was moved to Aruba in the 1960s. 6. Bubali Bird Sanctuary Opposite the windmill is the Bubali bird sanctuary. This wetland is an important resting and breeding place for many bird species. The reserve is not only home to local birds, but also provides a pit stop for more than 80 species of migratory birds. The reserve consists of two freshwater lakes, and there’s also a watchtower from where you can observe these exotic birds.",

      "content": "Top 6 things to do in Curaçao Its wild landscapes, pristine beaches, and pastel-colored Dutch colonial architecture combine to make Curaçao a fascinating place to visit. The island is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and is in the southern Caribbean, just off the coast of Venezuela. Wherever you are on the island, you'll find palm trees, a vibrant food scene, and friendly locals. Its history-steeped capital, Willemstad, boasts a palette of made-for-Instagram colors, while you can also learn about the island’s past in one of the former sugarcane plantations. And a day at sea is another must-do when in Curaçao. 1. Explore historic Willemstad Photogenic gabled façades and a UNESCO World Heritage Site old town make Willemstad stand out from the crowd. The capital of Curaçao is the perfect place to experience life like a local. Stroll along the colorful Handelskade waterfront to historic Fort Amsterdam, shop in authentic boutiques, and enjoy an evening of live music and good food in Pietermaai. For a bit of history, check out the oldest synagogue in the Americas and St Anne’s Basilica plus the opulent villas of Scharloo, which is just a short walk from the old town. 2. Try out some water activities With miles of sandy beaches washed by crystalline waters, Curaçao is a mecca for water sports lovers. Activities range from diving and snorkeling to paddleboarding and catamaran cruises. Playa Kalki, the Grote Knip beach, and Playa Piskado are very popular with snorkellers because of their coral reefs and sea turtles. 3. Sail to Klein Curaçao Uninhabited Klein Curaçao makes for a perfect escape. Book a catamaran cruise to this islet, which lies 10km southeast of Curaçao, and enjoy a day on a desert island. You can snorkel among turtles, laze on sun-kissed beaches, take selfies by shipwrecks or make the short trek to the half-abandoned lighthouse in the heart of the island. And after any exertions, there are reed-roofed beach bars where you can relax over a drink. 4. Explore Curaçao’s wild landscapes in a 4x4 Book a 4x4 safari and discover Curaçao’s diverse landscapes. Some of the places you should not miss are Mount Christoffel, which is the highest point on the island, the sandy plains of San Pedro, and the remote Sint Joris Bay. Also worth a detour are the Hato cave and the flamboyance of flamingos at St Willibrordus – but don’t feed them. 5. Landhuis Knip country manor Landhuis Knip, or Kenepa, houses an important piece of Curaçao's history. It is located on a plantation that saw an important slave revolt at the end of the 18th century. Led by Tula, hundreds of slaves began a month-long quest for freedom. It now houses a museum, where you can learn about the history of slavery on the island and see antique furniture from the era. 6. Drink Curaçao When in Curaçao, do as Curaçaoans do. The country’s name is synonymous with the distinct blue liqueur that’s been produced on the island for centuries. It’s made from a blend of the peel of bitter laraha oranges, sugarcane alcohol, and spices – and not all versions are blue. Some of the distilleries offer guided tours, where you can learn all about the drink’s history and the production process before rounding off with a tasting.",

At the port of Enge, you can sit astounded by the mountain views reflected in Lake Zurich.For a taste of traditional Switzerland, stroll among the mansions of the Zürichberg district and the churches of the old town, then take the cogwheel train up to Grand Hotel Dolder for a hot chocolate and some breathtaking views of the city, lake and towering Alps. The university quarter is a good place for a coffee and a visit to the art museum if the weather turns badExcursions from Zurich include the sporting center of Interlaken, whose mountain-thronged views offer innumerable ways to get out of breath. The Rhine Falls, Mount Rigi and the medieval castle of Laufen are just short trips away, or you might consider a day in nearby Lucerne. Lucerne’s old town is worth a trip in itself, but the surrounding scenery is even more tempting. Take the cable car up to Mt Titlis for the Alpine panorama and test your nerve on the world’s highest suspension footbridge.",

      "content": "Tucked into a loop of the river Aare in central Switzerland, the laid-back city of Bern doesn’t feel like a capital city. But what it lacks in frenetic urban bustle and traffic it makes up for with crooked streets that ooze history, and plenty of cultural diversions. The Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a highlight with its handsome streets, fountains, and medieval architecture. The Federal Palace, seat of the Swiss government, serves up great views of the city and the distant Alps from its terrace. Visitors can explore the Einstein Museum, head uphill on the Gurtenbahn funicular for a birds-eye view of the city, or check out the Bear Park, where the city’s mascots – a pair of brown bears - live in a spacious enclosure. For foodies, sampling Swiss specialities like cheese fondue, rosti, and chocolate is a must. Bern also offers great shopping, especially for Swiss watches and crafts. Top six things to do in Bern1. Wander around the UNESCO Old Town Bern’s medieval old town is like something out of a film. Medieval buildings, flags, and cobbled streets take visitors back in time. Look out for the colourful public water fountains scattered about. With over 100, they’re a major part of the city. Take a trip up Switzerland’s tallest cathedral – Bern Minster – for views of the river, red-tiled roofs and pretty bridges. 2. Get a glimpse of the Zytglogge Clock Tower in action Dancing bears, cheeky fool and rooster come out every hour at Bern’s charming clock tower located in the old town. It’s a fascinating display and a beloved monument of the old town. You can go inside to see behind-the-scene mechanisms and learn about what the figures represent. There’s an astrological clock and viewing platform to enjoy inside too. 3. Take a stroll in the Rosengarten Located at the top of a hill, this peaceful spot is the perfect place for a picnic, panoramic views and your daily dose of nature. Relax among the sweet scents of over 200 varieties, along with other flowers too. There’s a tranquil pond, pavilion and restaurant too. Make sure to get a picture on the Einstein bench with the backdrop of Bern and the surrounding area. 4. Step inside the Federal Palace of SwitzerlandHome to the national parliament and a green dome that you won’t be able to miss – this is one of Bern’s most important buildings. Inside, you’ll get to see mesmerising stained glass windows, statues and chambers. Outside in Parliament Square, admire more Renaissance-style buildings and the impressive statue with 26 jets symbolising the cantons of Switzerland. 5. Experience culture, art and history in Bern Head to Bern’s History Museum for a blast of the past and discover a fascinating collection of over 200 dioramas. Discover Albert Einstein's memorabilia at the museum, including his 1921 Nobel Prize certificate and see where the famed scientist lived in the city centre. If art’s your thing, head to the Kunstmuseum for world-class art, or the Paul Klee Center for modern works and wavy architecture. 6. Walk along the Aare River The dazzling turquoise waters are what make Bern’s panoramas pop – magically formed by tiny melting glacier particles in the riverbed. Stroll along the riverside, stop at a cute restaurant or hire canoes. A cruise or boat tour is a great way to admire the views, or you can head to Bern’s famous Nydeggbrücke bridge. In summer, immerse yourselves like the locals and go for a dip.",

The beachfront has been developed for tourism, but with low-rise buildings and a well-tended promenade, it has retained its appeal. The real charm, however, lies in the atmospheric lanes of the old hillside village, awash with flowers and pretty houses with bright woodwork.Pottering through the lanes of the old town, stopping at a café or visiting the church is a great way to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of this photogenic spot. But if you are looking for more things to do in Altea, consider a boat trip or perhaps a hiking adventure in the mountains nearby.Top three things to do in Altea1. Take in the view from the old townMake your way through the cobbled streets to the blue-domed church of Our Lady of Consolation – take a peek inside to see its richly decorated interior. For broad views over the rooftops and along the coast, head for Mirador de los Cronistas de España or Mirador Blanc.2. Relax on the beachWander the two-kilometre-long promenade to pick your patch of sand - there’s plenty to choose from in Altea. La Roda beach and L’Espigó beach boast clean water and white sand mixed with pebbles, and as they are right in front of the town there’s plenty of bars and shops right behind.3. Venture on an excursionBoat trips are a popular day out from Altea. Choose from a variety of itineraries – some include beaches and BBQs, others set sail at sunset for a romantic cruise. A 30-minute drive inland brings you to the scenic perched village of Guadalest, while Alicante, Valencia and Benidorm are also within reach.",

Since 1945 the area first developed traditional heavy industry and moved then to service industries and high technology. In 2010 the Ruhr region was one of the European Capitals of Culture. In the Ruhr region you can follow the Industrial Heritage Trail and explore the old coal mines in the industrial museums.

With a population of 25,000, this relatively small town has a rich historical importance which can be seen through the impressive Plassenburg Castle where the Hohenzollern dynasty once lived and ruled. It’s perched on a hill above the old town and is the perfect place to go for photos of the city. The town was also an important site for trade in the Middle Ages due to its proximity to major cities in the region like Nuremberg and Bamberg - including an impressive brewing presence.Top 6 things to do in Kulmbach1. See the city’s landmark of Plassenburg Castle This striking hilltop castle is one of the best in Germany. You’ll enter through the German Renaissance-style courtyard and admire amazing views of Kulmbach from above! Inside, you can find various museums including the largest pewter museum in the world with over 300,000 figures and an interesting military museum. 2. Get lost in the cobbled streets of the historic Old Town The old town is host to beautiful brick towers that belonged to the old medieval fortifications of the city, monastery, town hall, bath house and churches. Don’t miss out on the marketplace square with shops, restaurants and cafes and the local farmer’s market on Wednesdays and Saturdays. 3. Why not try some of the local sausages? The Kulmach Bratwurst is the local sausage that can be found in many street stalls throughout the city center. They are served in long rolls sprinkled in aniseed called Stölla. The exact recipe for this local specialty is a well-kept trade secret of every Kulmacher butcher! 4. Beer lovers will be spoilt for choice in the ‘secret beer capital’ Discover Kulmbach’s rich beer history at one of the many breweries dotted around the town. The largest is the Kulmbacher Brauerei and yes, you can get beer samples along the way! Why not visit the 3-in-1 visitor centre (located in the former Mönchshof brewery) for the Bavarian Brewery Museum, Bavarian Bakery Museum and German Museum of Spices. 5. Get insider knowledge and take part in local festivals and celebrations Experience local culture at the Kulmbach Fair that takes place from April to May, the Old Town Festival which livens up the town during the first weekend of July, or the magical Advent Market during the Christmas period.

      "content": "Introducing ColmarWith its abundant charm and long history, Colmar makes a great base for exploring the best of France's Alsace region. It’s a place that rewards sightseeing on foot, as the old town is a compact area with a network of canals, bridges and pretty lanes to discover. In summer, almost every building in the old town is adorned with flower-filled window boxes, and the colourful, half-timbered houses really do look as if they have been plucked straight from a fairy-tale. Take a stroll down Rue des Marchands, the town's main street, and explore the many squares and landmarks along the way, such as the Maison des Têtes, a 16th-century building adorned with hundreds of carved heads. Take some time out to indulge in the local cuisine, especially the Alsatian tarte flambée and the delicious local wines.Top three things to do in Colmar1. Explore the Unterlinden MuseumHoused in a former Dominican convent, the Unterlinden Museum is one of Colmar's top attractions. It boasts an impressive collection of artwork, including pieces by famous artists such as Grünewald, Monet, and Picasso. Don't miss the stunning Isenheim Altarpiece.2. Join a boat trip on the river LauchFor a fresh perspective on the Petite Venise (Little Venice) neighbourhood, why not hop onto a traditional ‘barque’ wooden boat and tour the waterways of Colmar. You’ll get a close up look at some of those pretty riverside houses, and see some areas of the town it’s hard to reach on foot.3. Take a Wine Tasting TourColmar sits at the heart of Alsace's wine region, so it's a great place to sample the local vintages. You can take a wine tasting tour of the surrounding vineyards, or simply visit one of the town's many wine bars or cellars to try some of the best Alsatian wines. Why not pair them with some local cheese or charcuterie?",

The city was the seat of power of the Counts of Carcassonne, and then of the famous Trencavel family in the 12th century. Following the Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229), when the Royal forces seized Carcassonne, accusing it of complicity with the Cathars, it became a Royal fortress governed by a seneschal.In the 19th century, the city was on the verge of demolition and was used as a stone quarry. For over 50 years (1853-1911), Viollet-le-Duc and his successor Paul Boeswillwald gave it back its medieval appearance, destroying the secondary constructions between the outer walls, using grey roofing stone for the towers, and restoring the décors and hoardings. In the 1960s, the Gallo-Roman towers were topped with tiles.Carcassonne has plenty to offer to visitors today. Take a guided tour of the magnificent medieval citadel, Cité de Carcassonne, and find out about its rich history. With 52 towers and walls that distance 1.9 miles surrounding the citadel, explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site and see for yourself what life was like for those who lived inside the cité. Don't forget to pay a visit to the Château Comtal and ramparts to learn how the city defended itself against sieges during the medieval period.There are numerous museums that are worth visting during your time in Carcassonne. Visit the Musee de l'Inquisition (Museum of the Inquisition) and see the different torture methods and instruments used during the Spanish and French inquisitions. If you prefer something a bit less extreme, you can learn about the education system in the 19th century at the Musee de l'Ecole.Pick up the perfect souvenir for yourself or a family member at one of the many boutiques and artisan shops to help remember your time spent inside this medieval beauty!",

Located along the narrowest point in the English Channel, it is the closest French town to England. The city has been an important center for trading since the Middle Ages, and even came under English control in 1347 until its capture by the French in 1558. During World War II, it was a bombing target of the invading German forces who took the town during the siege using its strategic position to build bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles at England.Take a tour of the old town, situated on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbors. In its center, you'll see the Place d'Armes, in which stands the 13th-century watchtower - Tour du Guet. Step inside the Église Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy. Then walk to see the Parc St Pierre, the Hôtel-de-ville (the town hall) and the belfry from the early 20th century.Aside from its well-known connection route and old town, Calais is also famous for the lace industry and has a notable Museum of Fine Arts. Visit The Cité de la Dentelle et de la Mode museum of lace to learn about machine lace making. Then, admire the Rodin collection at the Fine-art museum.",

Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers, the Mayenne, the Sarthe, and the Loir, all coming from the north and flowing south to the Loire. Their confluence, just north of Angers, creates the Maine, a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometers south.Angers enjoys a rich cultural life, made possible by its universities and museums. The old medieval center is still dominated by the massive château of the Plantagenêts, home of the Apocalypse Tapestry, the biggest medieval tapestry ensemble in the world. Angers is also both at the edge of the Val de Loire, a World Heritage Site, and the Loire-Anjou-Touraine regional natural park.",

The Romanesque monument has been adapted over the centuries, but the beautiful, golden stone cloister remains one of the best-preserved examples in Europe. A visit to the monastery and the museum it houses is a highlight of any trip to Sant Cugat del Vallès.Visit Sant Cugat’s marketsAs well as the lively weekly market held on Placa Octavia every Thursday, you shouldn’t miss the historic Mercat Vell, a mini version of Barcelona’s Boqueria. Alongside the produce stalls, you will also find little eateries serving everything from Catalan specialities to Mexican and Asian dishes. The town’s daily antiques market is also well worth a browse.Explore the quirky museumsNot only does Sant Cugat boast Europe’s only museum devoted to Marilyn Monroe, but it also offers a museum of comics and illustration, with an impressive collection of graphic art. The Casa Aymat is home to the museum of modern tapestry, and the modernist wine cellar has exhibits on winemaking as well as the architect Cèsar Martinell.",

      "content": "Granada is a city with a unique face in Europe and around the world, because of its perfect synthesis of typical elements of Iberian and Arabic cultures. Granada, which was conquered by the Moors such as much of Spain, was the last city to be taken over by the Catholic monarchs in 1492, thus maintaining a strong Middle Eastern sign.The particular charm of this Andalusian town origins from this \"mezcla\" (mixture) and also from the geographical position of Granada, which lies between two rivers, at the foot of the Sierra Nevada and not far from the Mediterranean Sea. The most important and famous attraction of the city is undoubtedly the Alhambra, a Moorish fortress that was built in the XIV century and contains the splendid palaces where Arab emirs lived, with magnificent mosaic tiling, patios and gardens.The Alhambra was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the Moorish Albaicín district (with the breathtaking view of the Mirador San Nicolas) and the gardens of the Generalife, a suggestive crowning of the rural residence of the emirs.Granada also shows a typically Western sign, which is evident in charming Renaissance buildings such as the Cathedral, one of the major works of the Spanish Renaissance.A lively university city, Granada has so much to offer in terms of entertainment, nightlife, bars (such as the bars of Calle Elvira and the Middle East teahouses of Calle Caldereria Nueva) and gastronomic delights (try the tortilla of Sacromonte, gazpacho, beans with jamón, migas and remojón).",

Here at the southernmost part of Europe, you’ll discover a land that’s a little bit Europe, a little bit Africa and something else entirely. The vast dunes of Maspalomas might make you think you’re in the Sahara. Certainly, there are camels to take you into the rolling, golden sands accompanied by their Saharawi guides. If you prefer your desert activities more frenetic, you can also explore the area by off-road jeep or 4x4 buggy. Las Palmas is a wonderful base from which to explore. Quite apart from the great nightlife and restaurants, there are plenty of attractions. Pueblo Canario is a recreation of a traditional Canarian village, complete with historical costumes, live music and cultural insights. The town has also been the location for a number of movies (Wild Oats, Moby Dick, Allied) and there are tours taking you to the different places that featured on-screen. For something really different, visit Sioux City, a Western-themed theme park in San Bartolome de Tirajana. Set in a cactus-dotted canyon, the park perfectly replicates the American Wild-West with fun shows, presentations and non-lethal shootings that will entertain kids and provide wry amusement for their parents. Alternatively, strap on a backpack and head off into the stunning interior for some excellent hiking. Roque Nubio is a notable geological formation whose views are definitely worth the walk.",

Indeed, Jandia Natural Reserve and Corralejo Nature Reserve are playgrounds for all kinds of travelers. The dunes at Corralejo are the largest of the whole Canary archipelago and are home to diverse animal and plant species you’ll see nowhere else. For a great view of the area, hike up to the Pico de la Zarza, Fuerteventura’s highest point at 807m (246ft), or simply play a round at the gorgeous Jandia Golf Course. Lobos Island is another natural gem for wildlife and watersports. With mask and snorkel, you can swim among grouper, damselfish, lizardfish, parrotfish, octopus, seahorses and possibly even rays or angel sharks. No people live on the island since the lighthouse-keeper left, in the 1960s, but you may meet some monk seals. The food on Fuerteventura is great. The majorera goats in particular are known for their excellent cheeses, but you can also taste great preserves and honey. Fancy some seasoning?

      "content": "Top six things to do on the Costa del Sol Stretching for 150km along the Mediterranean coast of Malaga, the Costa del Sol offers a wealth of activities. And with more than 325 days of guaranteed sunshine per year, it’s fair to say the name ‘Sunny Coast’ is pretty apt. In the summer, you can laze on the beach by day, then feast on fresh seafood in the evening. While the weather during the rest of the year is perfect for sightseeing and adventures. From city trips to Malaga to excursions in whitewashed mountain villages and plenty of water activities in the Mediterranean, the choice of things to do in the Costa del Sol is huge. 1. Visit Malaga and Mijas Malaga and Mijas offer contrasting visions of the Costa del Sol – the vibrant and the laidback. The history-steeped old town of Malaga is packed with monuments, such as the hilltop Moorish fortress, the ruins of a Roman theatre and a vast baroque cathedral. Then, there are the things that make Malaga special – squares and side streets lined with thronged bars, serving charcoal-grilled sardines, succulent clams, and steaming hot spicy prawns, washed down with a cool sherry. On the cultural front, the Picasso Museum – the great maestro was born in Malaga – and the Pompidou at the port are must-visits. A bit inland is the whitewashed town of Mijas. Here, you can stroll through the winding streets lined with plants and flowers dangling from balconies. The real Andalusia. 2. Walk the Caminito del Rey One hour from Malaga is the Caminito del Rey – King’s Walkway – which leads through the Chorro Gorge. This jaw-dropping path is 8km long and is pinned to the face of sheer cliff walls, some 100m above the river that cuts through the gorge. With the necessary safety precautions in place, you can walk the path on your own or opt for a guided tour with a guide, who’ll give you the lowdown on the trail’s history and construction. It is the perfect activity for a bit of adventure on the Costa del Sol. 3. Go to Selwo Marina or the Crocodile Park Selwo Marina is the ideal place for a day out with the whole family. This wildlife park in Benalmadena is home to dolphins, sea lions, penguins, tropical birds, fish, and much more. In Crocodile Park, which is in Torremolinos, you can stand eye to eye with crocodiles of all shapes and sizes. It’s home to the largest collection of these prehistoric creatures in Europe. 4. Try your hand at some water activities With so many hours of sunshine and warm summers, the Costa del Sol is a mecca for water activities. You can choose from the region's largest water park in Torremolinos to wakeboarding, kite surfing, and jet-skiing. Prefer to take it easy? Then book a boat trip and admire the views of the mountains framing the coastline. During summer, the boats often make a stop so you can cool off in the Med. 5. Take a guided tour of Ronda Another must is the cliff-perched city of Ronda. Its dramatic 18th-century bridge, which crosses El Tajo gorge, connects the two parts of the city. A stream flows through the gorge some 120 meters below the town. Ronda is a warren of narrow, whitewashed alleys leading on to tree-shaded squares, Renaissance and Baroque churches, atmospheric tapas bars, and the oldest bullring in Spain. Another highlight is the Casa Don Bosco, an eclectic modernist palace, which boasts epic views over the gorge. 6. Hang out with monkeys on the Rock of Gibraltar A day trip to Gibraltar is one of the most popular activities in the Costa del Sol. This slice of British life under the sun is one of the most curious places on the planet. A tiny city at the foot of a massive rock jutting out of the Med, its red post boxes and police helmets look out of place in these Latin latitudes. Tour the tunnels inside the Rock, hand out with the Barbary apes in the upper Rock, browse the duty-free shops in the old town or spot dolphins on a boat trip in the Straits of Gibraltar. It’s jam-packed with options.",

The old Venetian port, the twisting alleys, the honey-colored stone, the smells from the restaurants and the bursts of fragrant purple bougainvillea . . . how many people have sat here over a coffee and dreamed of buying a little house on the waterfront? Photographers and bon vivants will love the town, and culture lovers won’t be disappointed. There are at least three excellent museums (the Archeological, the Byzantine and the Maritime) and a remarkable replica of a Minoan-era ship that was built for the 2004 Athens Olympics. Wherever you go, the food is likely to be fantastic, made with the rich ingredients of this fertile island. Chania makes a natural base for sightseeing and tours. Whether you like boat excursions or mountain trekking, you can quickly go south to the colossal Samaria Gorge and barren White Mountains, or explore the little-visited west coast. The villages of the island’s mountainous center are largely untouched by the tourist hordes and worth visiting for exactly this reason.",

Bright boats bob at the harbourside, while tavernas spill their tables onto the promenade.A handful of small, town beaches are a good place for a quick paddle, but for a proper beach day complete with sunbeds and beach bars head 2km south to Almyros, or consider a boat trip to find more secluded sands. The chic resort of Elounda is just a short drive away, good for seaside tavernas and boat trips to Spinalonga Island.Top three things to do in Agios NikolaosSoak up the relaxed atmosphere in townAgios Nikolaos spreads over a headland, around a little lake and along the bay on either side, so it has a good stretch of waterfront ideal for a stroll. There are plenty of bars and restaurants with shore-side seating, and some pretty pedestrianised streets in the centre which are great for souvenir hunting.Hop on a boat trip to SpinalongaThe fortress-topped rocky islet of Spinalonga beckons the curious to explore. The Venetian fortifications proved effective when the island resisted Ottoman invasion for nearly fifty years longer than mainland Crete. Walk up to the top of the hill and you will be rewarded with great views. In the 20th century, Spinalonga became a leper colony, a story made famous by Victoria Hislop’s novel, The Island. Today the village reveals the fascinating and sad story of the former inhabitants.Head inland for some historyMeander back from the coast for 15 scenic minutes by car and you will be transported to a different Crete. Kritsa, one of the island’s oldest villages, oozes charm. Flower-filled lanes lead between sugar cube houses that cluster in the crook of the hills. Kritsa’s Panayia Kera church is famed for Crete’s finest Byzantine frescoes. The ancient Lato archeological site is nearby and worth a visit for the wonderful setting.",

The city itself has sights to offer: the old town, the tramway, the theatre, cathedrals etc. But many would agree when we say that local people make the special vibe in the city. The countyside is worth to visit as well: don’t miss out a trip to the breathtaking mountain landscapes, and learn about the ancient history of Georgia and its legends. Main highlights would be the Zhinvali reservoir, the medieval fortress of Ananuri, and mineral springs. The monastery at the foot of the great Kazbeg is a sight that everyone will suggest you to see.

Called \"Le Jardin de la France\" (\"The Garden of France\"), Tours is located between two rivers, the Loire to the north and the Cher to the south which make the city quite green. Tours is famous also for its original medieval district, called le Vieux Tours with unique preserved half-timbered buildings and la Place Plumereau, a square with busy pubs and restaurants, whose open-air tables fill the centre of the square. .Near the cathedral of Tours, in the garden of the ancient Palais des Archevêques (now Musée des Beaux-Arts), is a huge cedar tree planted by Napoleon. Funny fact, the garden also has in an alcove a stuffed elephant, Fritz. He escaped from the Barnum and Bailey circus during their stay in Tours in 1902. He went mad and had to be shot down, but the city paid to honor him, and he was stuffed as a result.",

It was used for the anointing, the most important part of the coronation of French kings. People know Reims also as the city of wine where many of the largest champagne-producing houses have their headquarters and most open for tasting and tours.

The meeting of the salty wind that blows in from the Ligurian Sea and the snow from the Apennine Mountains makes this a unique corner of Piedmont in the province of Alessandria. One glass of Gavi DOCG, a white wine to be enjoyed both young and aged, expresses the delicate yet elegant smells of the acacia flowers blooming in the spring, almonds and honey, as well as the fresh, savory taste of this rich land, antique like its winemaking tradition that dates back to 972. It is precisely in this period that the surprising liveliness of the Oltregiogo, the inland area of Genova, began to develop. This is a rich and fertile land, crossed by the Via del Sale and the Via Postumia, the main business streets that were established after the feud between the men of Zena, who already controlled the sea traffic of the area. Today, this area still mirrors the ancient ways of Genova in its architecture, territorial identity, language and especially its cuisine heavy in vegetables and fish. And there you have it - this unique land called Piedmont is home to one of the most important white wines, the Gavi DOCG. A still yet to be explored corner where you can find slow tourism and travel paths linked closely to nature and the beauty of the uncontaminated landscapes including the Nature Reserve of the Piedmont Apennines and many picturesque places glorified by antique villas and country homes. History and culture mix in the discrete luxury of the country resorts, golf clubs and worthy local sights such as the Museo dei Cappuccini di Voltaggio, the archaeological area of Libarna in Serravalle Scrivia and the Musei dei Campionissimi (dedicated to cycling) in Novi Ligure (in partnership with the Piemonte Region - PSR 2014-2020 - European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development).",

      "content": "Top 6 things to do in FlorenceThe Renaissance was born in this small city with world-class appeal. Offering you a glimpse at one of the richest cultural and artistic periods of our history, visiting Florence is like taking an enchanting step back in time. Admire artistic masterpieces from the likes of Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Botticelli and Brunelleschi. Discover frescoed churches and grand palazzos in its historic center, listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site. With so much timeless beauty around you, it’s easy to have your dizzying ‘Stendhal’ moment. So we’ve made it easier. From its iconic cathedral with its soaring dome to the towering Palazzo Vecchio and world-class museums, we narrow it down to what you absolutely can’t miss.1. Uffizi GalleryMarvel at some of the greatest works of the Renaissance in these former government offices. Its formidable collection was gifted to the state by the last of the Medici in 1743 and includes Caravaggio’s hair-raising Medusa, Botticelli's renowned Birth of Venus and Titian’s titillating Venus of Urbino.2. DuomoFlorence’s cathedral is impossible to miss. With its stupendous red-tiled dome and marbled facade in pink, green and white, it’s become an iconic city symbol. While the inside is less elaborate, you’ll still be dazzled by the wonderfully detailed fresco by Vasari and Zuccari and the 44 stained-glass windows.3. Accademia GalleryNo visit to Florence is complete without marveling at Michelangelo’s smooth and sinewy David. Carved from a single block of marble, this famed work became a symbol of Florentine power. While it’s the museum’s indisputable star, other highlights include paintings by Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, and Orcagna.4. Florentine foodTuscan cuisine is simple, hearty, and irresistable. Its star dish is the bistecca alla fiorentina, a juicy T-bone slab of meat that’s not for the faint-hearted. But the lesser-known ribollita soup and tripe sandwiches are also flavorsome delicacies well worth a try. Top it all off with a glass of quality local wine.5. Palazzo Pitti & Boboli GardensFormer home to a Florentine banker, Italian kings and even Napoleon, this Renaissance palace’s rich history dates back to 1458. Now it’s the place to gush over sumptuous rooms filled with porcelain, jewelry, and art from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The spectacular terraced garden is also worth a stroll.6. Palazzo VecchioBuilt between 1298 and 1314 for the signoria (city government), this austere palace has long been the seat of Florentine civil power. Marvel at its enormous Hall of the Five Hundred and even delve into the Medici's world of intrigue through the hidden passages. The 94m-high tower also offers sweeping views.Planning your Florence visitWhen to go?While there’s never a bad time to visit Florence, spring and autumn will let you enjoy the city at its very best. The weather is sunny without being too hot, attractions are busy without being packed, festivals are afoot and piazzas gently buzz with activity. Summer is still enjoyable but the city becomes sweltering hot, tourist numbers hit their peak, accommodation prices (naturally) go up and restaurants tend to close, especially those outside the center. We recommend the winter over the summer months. The weather is colder but attraction queues will most certainly be shorter. You’ll also get to enjoy various Christmas markets and see the city decked out in cozy lights and festive decorations. How many days should you spend?Florence is a bite-size city, so if you’re just looking to see the main attractions you’ll more than fit them in over a weekend. That said, Florence’s charms could easily be stretched over four to five days, giving you time to indulge a bit more in the hearty Tuscan food, people-watching at the piazzas and languid way of life. And if you ever find yourself with nothing to do, use the city as a takeoff point for exploring Tuscany and its idyllic towns such as Siena, Lucca and San Gimignano, to name a few.How to get there?Just 4km northwest of the city center lies the city’s main airport, Florence Airport. From here it’s a 10- to 15-minute shuttle (€6 one way) or tram ride (€1.50) to the central Stazione Santa Maria Novella. Otherwise a taxi costs €22 fixed price to the city center. Depending on where you’re arriving from, it may make more sense to fly into Pisa Airport. Trains and buses run regularly to Florence’s main train station, Stazione Santa Maria Novella. They cost between €11 to €15 one way and take from 60 to 90 minutes.How to move around the city?Florence is a small city and it’s easy to get around by foot. Most attractions are within walking distance from one another. It’s also possible to get around by bike in the center. Keep in mind that all forms of motorized non-resident traffic (ie cars, scooters and motorcycles) are banned in this area. The public transport system is also quite efficient and comes in handy when you want to get up the hill to Piazzale Michelangelo. A one-way ticket costs €1.50 and is valid for 90 minutes. Other ticket options include a 10-trip carnet for €14 or a monthly travel pass for €35.Where to shop?Florence’s unique mix of old-world charm, high-end boutiques and quaint artisanal workshops make it a pleasure to shop. Via de Tornabuoni is the city’s most glamorous street, dedicated to luxury fashion houses, including those that famously made their names here: Emilio Pucci, Salvatore Ferragamo and Gucci. Otherwise, if you’re looking for something a little less upmarket, Via Roma and Via dei Calzaiuoli offer more mainstream brands and the Rinascente shopping center. Instead, head to Via del Parione if you want to see Florence’s artisanal side. Leather accessories, marbled stationery and locally designed jewelry can all be found here. The street is also home to some cool modern boutiques and vintage stores.",

The stuffed rice balls (arancini) are highly recommended, as is the puff-pastry-mozzarella-and-ham creation known as the cipollina.

Subsequently it was the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1324 to 1720, and then from 1798 to 1814.Legend has it that Caralis was founded by Aristaeus, son of the god Apollo and the nymph Cyrene, in the fifteenth century b.C. Its long history and the various dominations and outside influences have meant that the city has a very rich cultural and architectural heritage.The fortified district of Castello is the Medieval heart of the city, which until the Second World War was the residence of the nobles. A religious building worthy of note is the Basilica of San Saturnino, which is the oldest church in Sardinia which we have news, built in the fifth century and restored in the Romanesque period. Do not miss the archaeological site of Tuvixeddu, the largest Phoenician-Punic necropolis still exists that stands on the hill of the same name. In addition to the Punic tombs are also tombs from the Roman era.",

      "code": "patmos",
      "content": "Sleepy Patmos is one of the smaller islands in the Dodecanese chain, but though it’s petite, the influence of its past echoes down the centuries. It was here on Patmos that St John wrote the book of Revelations, and today the island is an important stop for Christian pilgrims. Paying a visit to the imposing Monastery of St John is one of the best things to do on Patmos – the fortress-like monument boasts ancient frescoes, a rich museum and fabulous views. There are just two major villages on Patmos, both worthy of your time. Pretty Skala spreads around the harbour, while atmospheric Chora encircles the famous hilltop monastery. The island’s serrated coastline hides several good beaches and hiking trails weave across the hills, tempting you to explore.Top Six Things to Do in Patmos1. Visit the Monastery of St JohnCrowning one of the island’s biggest hills, the dark stone walls of the Monastery of St John are visible from almost everywhere on Patmos. Built almost a thousand years ago, the monastery has been constantly occupied by monks who have used income from visitors to create an impressive collection of Christian artefacts. Many are restored on site and put on display in the museum, which showcases one of Greece’s most important collections of orthodox iconography. The building itself is also fascinating – adorned with frescoes, terraces, and numerous chapels.2. See The Cave of the ApocalypseAnother important stop on Patmos’s spiritual trail is the Cave of the Apocalypse which is the actual spot where St John received his revelations. God’s voice reached him through a crack between the rocks of the cave wall, and it was here that these visions were written down as the Book of Revelations. The cave today has a small monastery to mark its significance, and it’s a popular destination for religious tours of the island.3. Explore ChoraClustered at the foot of the mighty Monastery of St John, the densely packed lanes of Chora village are a treat to explore. Whitewashed houses huddle together along narrow streets, occasionally opening onto a small square with a pretty chapel. Flowers trail over walls and cats bask in sunny corners, and often there’s not a soul to be seen other than vendors selling mementoes and religious trinkets to visitors. Because of its location on top of a hill, views from Chora over the rest of the island are a highlight.4. Get to know SkalaBack down at sea level, the island’s main town – Skala - stretches around the natural harbour where ferries from surrounding islands dock. It’s situated at one of the narrowest points on the island, so you can cross to the opposite shore in just ten minutes or so on foot. Despite its small size and population, Skala sees a lot of visitors passing through from ferries and cruise ships, so there is a good choice of shops, beachfront tavernas, town bars and tourist facilities.5. Go Barefoot on Patmos’s best BeachesConsidering the extent of its corrugated coastline, Patmos does not have many large beaches. But what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. Most beaches of any size boast a summer beach bar or taverna, and many have a few trees behind the sand for shady lounging. Some of the wilder, often nudist, coves are best reached by boat, and one of the best beaches – Psili Ammos, is accessible by a 30-minute hike over a rocky spur. For more accessible beach time, aim for Agrio Livadi, Kampos and Grikos which are all reachable by road.6. Step aboard for a boat tripIn summer, numerous boat trips depart from the port of Skala every day. Some potter around the coast of Patmos stopping at hidden beaches, others venture further afield to neighbouring islands. Scheduled ferries run to year-round to Athens as well as the closer major islands of Samos, Kos and Rhodes. Local ferries chug over to the nearby islands of Leros, Lipsi, Arki, and Marathi, though outside of high season the frequency is drastically reduced. There is no airport on Patmos, so unless you arrive by helicopter, your visit will definitely involve a boat trip.",

Hop on a boat over to Bourtzi Fortress, which sits in the middle of the port. Or admire it from the harbour itself. Last but not least, check out Akronafplia - the town’s oldest castle.Get lost in the Old TownA stroll around the Old Town is the perfect way to soak up Nafplio’s charm. Leave the map behind and meander along the cobbled streets, lined with neoclassical buildings, small shops and boutiques.

Take a walking tour to experience Paraportiani church, the old waterfront, Little Venice (really!) and the Alefkandra area.

In Matoyiannia, on the other hand, international high fashion tempts you.Venture out from the town and the pleasures of little Mykonos are breath-taking. The cubist collections of white houses at Ano Mera are built in the Cycladic style, and it seems you’re never far from an old monastery like the sixteenth-century Panagia Tourliani. When you’ve reached ‘max monk’, head for the amazing beaches of Kalafatis or Agia Anna and enjoy some local cuisine. Ask for kopanisti cheese or the louza pork dish with a refreshing soumada to wash it down.History enthusiasts shouldn’t miss a boat excursion to the ancient site of Delos: sanctuary of Apollo and the place where all of the wealth of ancient Greece was once stored . . . before the Athenians helpfully offered to keep it ‘safe’ in Athens (i.e. spend it).",

Make your way up to the open-air Hellenistic amphitheatre for some top-class views of the city and lake – keep an eye out for summer performances too.2. See the iconic Church of Saint John at KaneoPositioned on a cliff above Lake Ohrid, this 13th-century church is one of Macedonia’s most photographed spots. It combines Byzantine and Armenian architectural styles and its location provides jaw-dropping views over the lake and surrounding mountains. Head up to Samuel’s Fortress for the best views – and it’s particularly special at sunset. 3. Spend some time around Lake Ohrid No trip to Ohrid would be complete without exploring its magnificent lake. Choose from different boardwalks for a leisurely stroll along the water's edge – some paths are right on the lake – and sit at one of the benches to take it in.

There are so many stories – both famous and infamous – about the place that a visit always comes with the spice of genuine adventure. A significant modernizing push in recent years means that you can now enjoy the benefits of an aspiring Morocco while still appreciating all of its historical and cultural wonders.There’s plenty to do. Enter the cobbled maze of the Kasbah via the Bab Haha gate and get lost among the traditional architecture. Or visit the Grand Mosque, which was a Roman temple and a Portuguese cathedral before it converted to Islam in the eighth century. The beaches are also quite stunning, and the Grand Socco is a wonderful shopping locale for buying traditional kaftans, nuts and fresh fruit. Treat yourself to a mint tea!Literature fans will want to make a pilgrimage to Rue Magellan, whose hotels accommodated Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs. Nowadays, it’s where the town’s hipsters hang out. Fans of Paul Bowles’ “The Sheltering Sky” will want to visit the museum of the Tangier American Legation Institute for Moroccan Studies, whose rooms exhibit treasures related to the author.A great day trip from Tangier is Asilah, one of Morocco’s most beautiful and well-preserved old cities. Walk its Portuguese ramparts, see the El-Kamra tower and visit the Palais de Raissouli, where a notable pirate once lived. With its own summer arts festival, Asilah is definitely a cultural center worth visiting at any time of the year.",

      "content": "The old town of Syracuse can be found on the small island of Ortygia in Sicily and is connected to the rest of the city by three bridges. A rich history runs through the island after being founded by the Greeks and then becoming part of the Roman Republic. Discover the cultural delights and architecture that the island offers as a result of the shared influences. A fun fact about Syracuse is that the mathematician Archimedes was killed here by a Roman soldier sent specifically to bring him safely back to Rome.Feel free to get lost among the streets of this beautiful old town. Syracuse’s Duomo is a mixture of architecture formed from the bits and pieces of two ancient Greek temples: the Temple of Athena and the Temple of Minerva. Admire the grandeur of the Doric columns which are thousands of years old! Around the square, you’ll also be able to see many aristocratic palazzi.\nAt the Archeological Park of Neapolis, you can find the 5th century BC Greek theatre and the Latomia del Paradiso limestone quarry from which much of ancient Syracuse was built. There are also catacombs and the famous ‘Ear of Dionysus’ – a manmade cave whose perfect acoustics allowed the eponymous tyrant to listen to the prisoners kept within. The second-century AD Roman amphitheater, site of predictably grisly gladiatorial combat, is also an extraordinary place to explore.\nTwo places definitely worth visiting from Syracuse are Ragusa and Modica. UNESCO-listed Ragusa has a spectacular mountain setting and is famous for its amazing natural produce such as cheese and olives. Modica is known for its chocolate, made in the same way that the Aztecs made it, according to a recipe brought back to the village by marauding Spanish conquistadors.",

At the Palatine Chapel you can enjoy the combined artistic heritage of the Arabs, Byzantines and Normans, while the ninth-century Palazzo dei Normanni is an astounding confection of luxurious decoration.\nAs you wander the medieval streets and alleys, make your way to the tempting city markets of Vucciria, Ballarò and Capo to see the locals shopping for lunch or to pick up some unforgettable street food. Suitably emboldened, you’re now ready for the old Arab-Norman fortifications and the domed wonder of St John of the Hermits. If you don’t mind a dusty old skeleton or two, head down into the catacombs and say ‘hi’ to some of Palermo’s earlier visitors.\nThere are also plenty of excursions from the city. Piazza Armerina is a town in the center of the island where you can explore the UNESCO-listed Villa Romana del Casale: a well preserved example of a deluxe Roman villa with lavish mosaics, thermal baths, a basilica and courtyard.

Enter one of the many “osterie” and taste the traditional “trofie al pesto”, or a typical Ligurian soup, the \"prebuggiun\" and the best local fish, such as the special salted anchovies from Monterosso.In addition to the many naturalistic beauties, Monterosso hosts countless artistic and architectural beauties, such as the Church of San Giovanni Battista and the seventeenth-century Church of San Francesco, built on the “colle dei cappuccini.”Monterosso is the largest of the Cinque Terre and thanks to its wide offer of beaches, nightlife and food, it has managed to capture the hearts of millions of travelers.",

      "content": "Constantly evolving and endlessly innovative, Rotterdam blazes its own trail. This is a city that refuses to settle for conventional solutions, instead forging ahead with radical projects to meet communal challenges. After much of the city was destroyed in the World War II, Rotterdam courageously looked to the future, taking bold steps forward in urban design. Progressive, youthful and visually striking, Europe’s largest cargo port will surprise and delight you with its quirky modern architecture, booming food scene and fantastic museums. Top 6 Things to Do in Rotterdam\n1. Discover the city’s obsession with art\nArt is everywhere in Rotterdam, from the world’s largest painting on the curved ceiling of the Markthal to the fresh and colourful street art dotted around the city. Rotterdam prides itself on being a city-wide, open-air, free gallery for all – best seen on a guided tour – but there are also impressive collections indoors at the Kunsthal, Witte de With, the Fotomuseum and TENT. The jewel in the crown has to be the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen, a uniquely curator-free collection of 150,000 artworks. 2. See the harbour from the water\nThe Rotterdam Water Taxi is a city phenomenon, slashing commuting times with small, speedy boats that travel up to 50km per hour. It makes a fun and practical way to see the city from a new perspective while getting from A to B. There are 50 stops in and around the city, and tickets are priced according to how many of the three zones you cross. For a more in-depth harbour tour, join a Spido boat trip passing landmarks like the Euromast, the Erasmus Bridge and the SS Rotterdam.3. Visit dazzling architectural marvels\nStrategically important Rotterdam was largely destroyed in World War II, which kickstarted its re-invention. Landmark buildings now dot the skyline, and the city of today is known for its bold and eclectic architecture. Take a tour of the best-known buildings in Rotterdam, including Centraal Station, Kunsthal in the cultural hub of Museumpark, and the landmark Erasmus Bridge. The famous Cube houses designed by Blom and the nearby Markthal are two more of the city’s many exciting buildings.4. Take a stroll around the historic quarter\nOne of the few districts of Rotterdam not to be flattened during the blitz, Delfshaven gives you a flavour of the pre-war city. Covering just a few streets and waterways, it’s not a large area but it packs in a lot of charm. Canals bristle with the wooden masts of old barges, and elegant, brick-fronted homes are reflected on the water. Take a break at the waterside De Pelgrim brewery or one of the classy restaurants that dot this characterful part of the city.5 Taste the world on a plate\nWith its huge variety of dining options and markets you won’t go hungry in Rotterdam. Any foodie worth their salt should definitely check out the Markthal, not only for its awesome architecture, but also for the fresh produce market and eateries ranging from local treats like stroopwafels to international cuisine. The Fenix Food Factory is a similar set-up – a farmers’ market with restaurants and cafés and an emphasis on sustainability.6. Explore breezy, beautiful Kinderdijk\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Site of Kinderdijk is the perfect contrast with Rotterdam. Just a short hop from the big city, this tranquil region of waterways and windmills showcases the Netherlands’ rural history and the challenges of water management in a landscape that sits at or below sea level. Two working windmills, a pumping station and a boat trip are all included in the entry fee, plus the informative visitor centre where you can enjoy widescreen views of the windmills from the café.",

It features an unforgettable history: 90% of Warsaw was destroyed during WWII, but thanks to its excellent restoration, the city was later granted the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

      "code": "amsterdam",
      "content": "Top 6 things to do in Amsterdam There’s more to Amsterdam than just the storybook charm of its Golden Age architecture and quaint canals. This pocket-size city likes to think big. Its acclaimed museums hold the world’s largest collection of Van Goghs along with impressive Rembrandts, Vermeers, and modern masters. While its eco-friendly attitude and proud history of embracing diversity has long attracted international attention. With so much going for it, we’ve made it easier for you by sharing our top picks. From the Rijksmuseum’s homegrown collection to Anne Frank’s heart-rending house, discover the best the city has to offer. And don’t forget to soak up some gezellig, the Dutch concept of coziness, at any number of bruin cafés. 1. Rijksmuseum Brimming with Dutch masterpieces such as Rembrandt’s The Night Watch, this museum is a must for art lovers. With over 8000 works on display, it’s impossible to see it all; head to the 2nd-floor Gallery of Honour for Golden Age art if you’re short on time. The intricate Delft pottery is also worth a look. 2. Van Gogh Museum With the world’s largest collection of Van Goghs, there’s no better place to explore the life and works of this troubled genius. Housing a mix of lesser-known drawings and famed paintings, it shows the fascinating transition of Van Gogh’s style, from somber Dutch landscapes to bright, swirling sunflowers. 3. Anne Frank’s story For two terrifying years, Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis in the back of a canal house from 1635. Seeing the airless annex in real life is an unforgettable and emotionally charged experience. A tour can also show you her childhood haunts and the shop where she bought her now-famous diary. 4. Canal tours Floating down its many canals is one of the most atmospheric ways to see the city sights. Extending around 62 miles, these canals are an iconic symbol of Amsterdam, while the picturesque 17th-century ring area is also UNESCO World Heritage Listed. Options range from general tickets to a luxury experience. 5. Bike riding In a country said to have more bikes than people, it’s only natural that the best way to explore the city is by bike. Not only do you get to experience Amsterdam like a local, but with over 320 miles of dedicated lanes it’s also a convenient way to get around. Less confident riders can opt for an easy bike tour. 6. Dutch countrysideCrisscrossed by canals and dotted with windmills, the Dutch countryside is as picturesque as it gets. Take a day trip from Amsterdam and discover the attractions just outside it. Top places to visit include Marken island, with its wooden homes, the windmills of Zaanse Schans, and the flower-filled fields of Keukenhof GardensPlanning your Amsterdam visit When to go? June to August is the peak tourist season which means there will be greater crowds, but you may be willing to brave them for the warm weather (perfect for cycling) and long days. Those wishing to avoid said crowds should come before or after the tourist peak season, between April and May or September and November. Good weather can’t be guaranteed, but it’ll be mild and at least you can enjoy the city at its laid-back best. March to May is also the time to catch those famed tulips in bloom. For those who don’t mind the cold and the short days, winter is an ideal time to nab a deal. Flights and accommodation are likely to be at their lowest. Plus, if the weather ever gets too much for you, you can always warm up in a cozy bruin café. How many days should you spend? This varies a lot depending on your traveling style. If you’re someone who likes an action-packed itinerary, you can see the main sights in two days as it’s a pretty compact city. If instead, you’re someone who likes to take it a bit slower and get into the rhythm of local life, you could take a week or even more. This will give you the time to explore the city on foot or with a bike tour, and let you include day trips to Zaanse Schans to see the windmills or Keukenhof to wander in the tulip fields. How to get there? Schiphol International Airport (also known as Amsterdam Airport) is the Netherlands ’ main airport and also one of Europe’s busiest. A convenient 5 miles from Amsterdam, it’s well-connected by trains that depart for Centraal Station around every 10 minutes from 6 am to 1 am; it runs hourly between 2 am and 5 am. The trip takes 15 minutes and tickets cost €5.50. Otherwise, the Connexxion Airport Express bus gets you to the center in 30 minutes (€6.50 one way; €11.25 return). Taxis cost around €45. How to move around the city? Amsterdam is a compact city, which makes getting around relatively easy. If you’re only going to be exploring the city center, you can get almost everywhere on foot. If you plan on using public transport, we recommend you get a 1- to 7-day GVB pass (available at GVB ticket offices). For most visitors, a combination of walking and taking trams will be all they need. Buses and trains are mainly used to connect to outer suburbs. Most locals get around by bike and if you feel like following their lead the city is well-equipped with bike lanes and rentals. Taxis are readily available, although they tend to be slower because of the maze-like streets. Where to shop? For shopping in the most photogenic of settings, nothing quite beats Negen Straatjes (Nine Streets). These narrow streets connecting the 17th-century canals are filled with historic charm and a mix of quirky vintage stores, hip cafes, trendy boutiques, and art galleries. Otherwise, if you’re looking for something a little bit more laid-back and local then De Pijp is the place for you. It has cool concept stores, local Dutch design, and a fantastic open-air market. Luxury lovers instead will want to strut their stuff down PC Hooftstraat, home to haute-couture brands such as Louis Vuitton, Mulberry, and DKNY. Finally, for antiques and art look no further than Spiegelkwartier, where you can splurge on everything from Delft pottery to 17th-century furniture.",

For centuries it’s enthralled visitors and inspired the work of some of the world’s most acclaimed writers and artists, from Victor Hugo to Van Gogh. Iconic monuments, world-class museums, elegant boulevards, and impossibly chic inhabitants are all part of its charm. So where to begin in this impeccable city? From its soaring Eiffel Tower to the boldly modern Centre Pompidou and sculpted Arc de Triomphe, we show you the best the city has to offer. And let’s not forget its glorious gastronomy, from delicate pastries to the humble baguette and creamy cheeses accompanied by earthy local wines. Discover it all and let this mesmerizing city cast its spell on you.1. Eiffel TowerConstructed by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World’s Fair, it’s hard to believe this iconic tower was ever intended to be temporary. Saved by its potential use as a radio antena, it’s become one of Paris’ most enduring symbols. Head to the third floor for city views (that get especially romantic at night).2. Louvre MuseumThere’s more to the Louvre than its gleaming glass pyramid and Da Vinci’s mysterious Mona Lisa. Home to more than 10,000 works, its collection runs the gamut from Egyptian antiques to Dutch masters such as Vermeer and Rembrandt. Highlights include the ancient Winged Victory of Samothrace and Venus de Milo.3. Arc de TriompheBegun in 1806 in honor of Napoléon’s recent victory at Austerlitz, it was another 20 years before his monumental arch was finally complete. Highlights include intricate sculptures such as Départ des Volontaires de 1792 (Departure of the Volunteers of 1792). You can also climb the 284 steps for sweeping views.4. Musee RodinGet to know this famed sculptor in the 18th-century mansion he used to call home. While many of his works are in the mansion itself, his most famous sculptures can be found in the surrounding rose garden. Exuding tranquility, the latter is the perfect place to ponder one of his greatest works: The Thinker.5. Centre PompidouFormer French president George Pompidou wanted a game-changing museum and he certainly got it. Famed for Its radical inside-out architecture, the museum houses cutting-edge exhibitions, performances, cinemas and an enviable permanent collection of French art. Don’t miss the panoramic view from the rooftop.6. French gastronomyHome to one of the world’s most renowned cuisines, there’s no excuse for not indulging in some fantastic foods, such as a light-as-air macaroon or some creamy camembert. Make your way from artisanal boulangeries to exquisite patisseries, cosy bistros and Michelin-star restaurants; you won’t be disappointed.Planning your Paris visitWhen to go?Paris will charm you regardless of the season. That said, the months from April to May and September to October are widely considered the best times to visit. You’ll miss the summer crowds while also getting to enjoy the mild yet sunny weather. Spring also lets you see the city in full bloom. Summer is the peak tourist season (June to August), when the weather is at its best and brightest and attractions are at their busiest. Some local establishments may also close during August. Winter is better for those looking to nab a deal as prices for both flights and accommodation tend to drop. Sights are less packed, although you’ll never have them to yourself as Paris attracts tourists all year round.How many days should you spend?Paris is a cosmopolitan city brimming with culture, history, shopping and fantastic nightlife. Three days might just be enough to pack in some of its main sights, but keep in mind you’d be on a tight schedule. Instead, we recommend you get to know the city at a more leisurely pace by spending five days to a week. This way you can see the city’s top attractions while also discovering its more hidden local side.How to get there?Charles de Gaulle is the city’s main airport and is connected to central Paris by train (RER) and bus; prices range from €6 to €18. If you're in a hurry a taxi is the fastest way to get into town (45 minutes) and costs €55-60.Orly Airport is 13km south of Paris. Getting to the city center is a little less direct unless you take a taxi (€35). If you go by train, you’ll have to change at the Antony station to lines RER B or RER C. It costs around €12 one way. Otherwise, the Orlybus will take you direct for €8.30 one way.Beauvais Airport is a small airport 80 km from Paris, which is mostly used by low-cost airlines. It takes 80 minutes approximately by airport shuttle to Porte Maillot (€17). Trains run to Gare du Nord station every 1 to 2 hours and cost €13-€16.How to move around the city?While the city is by no means small, it’s relatively easy getting around thanks to a speedy and efficient public transport system. The Metro and RER are the fastest modes of transport and operate from around 5:30 am to 1:15 am (Fridays and Saturdays the Metro stays open an hour later). There’s also a bus system run by RATP, which may be more convenient for families with strollers and those with limited mobility. Prices start from €1.90 for a single bus/train ticket. Paris is also becoming increasingly bike-friendly and this is a scenic way to explore the city. While you’ll spot various bike-share systems throughout the city such as Vélib', not all will accept foreign credit cards.Where to shop?With its well-heeled locals and chic boutiques, this is a city that knows a thing or two about style. Get your sartorial dose at any number of shopping districts. The Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré is the beating heart of designer fashion, with flagships stores from big-name brands such as Versace and Hermes. Otherwise, if you’re looking for something more niche head to Marais, which has everything from artisanal jewelers to trendy concept stores like Merci. Vintage lovers will go wild in Paris’ many flea markets; Saint-Ouen is the city’s largest and is a veritable treasure trove of pre-loved goods. Additionally, you can’t leave Paris without strolling through one of its covered arcades famed for their old-world beauty, such as the Galerie Vivienne.",

      "content": "Top 6 things to do in RomeA modern-day city steeped in history, Rome is an endless feast of art and culture. Italy’s capital and the first great metropolis of humanity, the city shows off three millennia of history in architectural and artistic treasures that will quite simply leave you breathless. You’ll never see it all, they say one lifetime is not long enough to see all Rome has to offer. But with our top picks you can see the city’s very best. Glimpse the city’s golden age with the Colosseum, Roman Forum and the Pantheon, or marvel at the might of the Catholic Church inside the stunning St Peter’s Basilica. Immerse yourself in the city’s timeless beauty, and don’t forget to lose yourself in the dolce vita lifestyle.1. ColosseumOpened in AD 80, this 50,000-seat gladiatorial arena is arguably Rome’s most spectacular sight. An iconic symbol of Imperial Rome, its inauguration was marked by games said to have lasted 100 days and nights, which led to the slaughter of 5000 animals. Its end was signaled by the fall of the Roman Empire.2. PantheonGaze in awe at this former Roman temple to the gods. Completed around AD 126, almost 500 years later it found new life as a Christian church. One of the best-preserved buildings from this era, mostly due to its continued use, walking beneath its granite columns and ingenious dome is an enthralling experience.3. Vatican MuseumsDiscover one of the world’s most impressive art collections, amassed throughout the centuries by the Roman Catholic Church. From Michelangelo’s breathtaking Sistine Chapel to Raphael’s masterly frescoes and more than 70,000 other exhibits, you’ll need to pace yourself for this heady art immersion.4. St Peter’s BasilicaThe holiest of catholic shrines, unparalleled both in size, beauty and riches, St Peter’s Basilica is the one cathedral you don’t want to miss. Highlights include the many artistic treasures found inside, such as Michelangelo’s Pietà, along with the immense dome and towering bronze baldachin by Bernini.5. Galleria BorgheseThanks to the scheming (and thieving!) by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, this is one of the best private art collections around. Not only featuring sensational works by Caravaggio, Raphael, Titian and Bernini, the villa is also a sumptuous backdrop to the masterpieces. Admission by reservation only.6. Roman ForumThese sprawling ruins were at the center of daily life in ancient Rome. Formerly filled with extravagant temples, government buildings and shops, wandering through lonely columns and stone fragments lets you reimagine its past grandeur. Top sights include the Temple of Saturn, Arch of Titus and the Curia.Planning your Rome visitWhen to go?Rome is sure to charm you all year round. That said, summer is its busiest period, in which case you might want to choose another time to avoid the crowds. It also tends to get quite hot and humid in the July and August months. Many prefer April to May or September to November, when the weather is sunny but cool and attractions are less packed. While winter is less popular, it’s still an ideal time to visit; prices are lower as it’s off peak, picturesque Christmas markets pop up everywhere, and there's also the unique opportunity to attend the Vatican’s Midnight Mass.How to get there?The Leonardo da Vinci airport in Fiumicino is Rome’s main international airport. The quickest way of getting to the center is by taking the Leonardo Da Vinci express (€14 one way), which takes just over 30 minutes. Instead, a taxi will cost €48 fixed fare. The Ciampino airport is smaller and is largely used by budget airlines. It’s slightly closer to central Rome. From here, public buses and trains run regularly to the Termini station and take around 50 to 60 minutes. Airport shuttles are also available (€6 one way), while taxis will set you back around €35.How many days should you spend?As it’s been famously said, there are more treasures in Rome than can be seen in one lifetime. A weekend will be enough to cover its main attractions, including the Colosseum and the Pantheon, but you could spend an infinite amount of time exploring its many ancient attractions and artistic masterpieces. And let's not forget the many pleasures of its languid lifestyle. Wander idly down picturesque alleys, enjoy people-watching in any number of scenic piazzas, feast on the city's spectacularly hearty cuisine and watch the time fly as you soak up that dolce vita.How to move around the city?Getting around Rome isn’t always easy. This is partly because of the many ruins buried under the city, which are often discovered when extending public transport lines. Not only do they delay construction, they also have to be circumvented, leading to longer and less direct routes. The metro is the quickest mode of transport but its network is limited. There are two main lines that service the centre: A (orange) and B (blue). Buses run by the ATAC also operate frequently; their main hub is in front of Termini station. Taxis are not that easy to hail and it's best to look for them at ranks or simply phone for one. If you’re looking to explore just the city center, we’d suggest you go on foot, which also lets you experience the ancient atmosphere up close.Where to shop?From designer flagships to independent boutiques and vintage troves, Rome has something to suit all tastes. Fashionistas flock to the fancy streets around the Spanish Steps, for their Gucci accessories and to nab themselves a Fendi purse. Otherwise, if that’s not your style, the charming Trastevere area has one-of-a-kind stores selling everything from antiques to perfume. Simply hit the shops between Via Garibaldi and Viale Trastevere. Instead vintage aficionados should head to Via del Governo Vecchio, which winds its way through the Centro Storico. Finally, if you’re looking for a more local experience Monti is for you; it’s the place to shop for up-and-coming Italian designers. Begin your browsing around Via del Boschetto and Via Panisperna.",

      "content": "Top 6 things to do in MilanFashion paradise, design haven and the epitome of old-school elegance, Milan is a city with many faces. And discovering them is all part of its charm. Known for seamlessly combining both the historic and the on-trend, it’s a place where haughty couture and chic dining goes hand-in-hand with magnificent palazzos, ancient churches and early Renaissance art. With so much to dazzle you, we’ve made it easier by selecting some of our all-time favorites. From gazing awe-struck at Da Vinci’s magnificent Last Supper, to admiring the Old Masters at the Pinacoteca or enjoying a night at the city’s world-famous opera house, we show you how to make the most of your trip to one of Italy’s most cosmopolitan cities.1. The Last SupperNothing compares to seeing one of Da Vinci’s greatest works in the flesh (so to speak). Faded and fragile, partly due to Da Vinci experimenting with an unusual mix of oil and tempera, it’s still a staggering work. Not least because of its striking composition and perspective, light years ahead of its time.2. The Duomo Six hundred years in the making, this epic white-marbled cathedral is not to be missed. Brimming with over a hundred spires and 3400 statues, it’s the city’s most elaborate symbol. Equally impressive is the interior with its enormous stained glass windows, while the rooftop offers spectacular views.3. PinacotecaImmerse yourself in the Old Masters, such as Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese to name a few. Our top highlights include Mantegna’s Lamentation over the Dead Christ with its fantastic perspective and brutal realism, along with The Kiss by Francesco Hayez, a passionate symbol of Italy’s unification.4. Galleria Vittorio Emanuele IIWith its glorious high arches of glass and steel, and marbled mosaic floors, the Galleria makes for an atmospheric stroll at any time of day. One of the world’s oldest shopping arcades, it’s also an ideal stop for high-end boutiques, with plenty of fancy dining options if you happen to get hungry.5. La ScalaA night at the opera reaches new heights when it’s at La Scala. One of the world’s famed opera houses, its stage has been graced by the likes of Maria Callas while Verdi built his impressive reputation here. For non-opera fans, there’s also ballet and classical music performances, along with theater tours.6. Da Vinci’s VineyardMany don’t know that while Da Vinci was painting the Last Supper, he was also tending to his nearby vineyard. Gifted to him by Duke Ludovico Sforza in 1498, it’s since been painstakingly recreated so not only can you saunter through the vines as Da Vinci might have done, you can also sip the same wine.Planning your Milan visitWhen to go?Milan is always a good idea, regardless of the month or season. In spring the weather is sunny and mild, while the city buzzes with international events such as Salone del Mobile and Fashion Week. Summer is also popular although it tends to get hot and humid, and the mosquitoes come out in droves. Locals flee the city, especially on the weekends, so it can be nice because the city feels a little less packed. Keep in mind though that come August and shops and restaurants outside of the center are likely to be closed or have summer trading hours. Autumn is ideal for the moderate weather and fewer tourists, while during the winter months you’ll get to enjoy the Christmas markets, opera season at La Scala and January sales.How to get there?The city is serviced by three airports. The Malpensa Airport is the main airport for international flights. From here to the city center it's a 50-minute shuttle bus or train ride (via the Malpensa Express; €13 one way). By taxi it will cost €90 fixed fare. The Linate airport is more centrally located and serves mainly domestic flights and those from within the EU. Coaches or public buses (No. 73) are a 30-minute ride to the center, while taxis cost around €20 to €30. The Bergamo airport (Orio al Serio) is used mostly by budget airlines and is a 1-hour bus ride (€8 one way) from central Milan.How many days should you spend?Milan is a city that can be explored over both a weekend, a week, or even a month. In 48 hours you’ll be able to experience all its main sights, from Leonardo’s Last Supper to a night at La Scala, but keep in mind you’ll have to plan in advance for most tickets. Instead, if you want to really immerse yourself in the city, we recommend you taking a little more time. Not only will you be able to shop the world-famed Quadrilatero d’Oro and wander the picturesque Navigli (canals), this will also give you time to get into the rhythm of the city and enjoy local delights, like a classic aperitivo.How to move around the city?The ATM runs the metro, bus and tram services. You’ll be able to get to most places via the metro, which has four underground lines (a fifth is projected for the near future): red M1, green M2, yellow M3, and lilac M5. There’s also the suburban rail network (the Passante Ferroviario), although it runs much less frequently. A single ticket costs €2; it’s valid either for one metro ride or 90 minutes of travel on buses and trams. Other ticket options include a 10-trip carnet (€18) or 3-day ticket (€12).Where to shop?Milan is renowned for shopping and there’s no shortage of high-end boutiques and classy consumer goods to swoon over. The Quadrilatero d’Oro is the city’s acclaimed shopping district. Framed by four streets - Via Monte Napoleone, Via Sant'Andrea, Via Senato and Via Manzoni - within is a back-to-back line-up of stores by fashion power brands, such as Gucci, Versace, Prada etc. You’ll find many of the same brands in the city’s main shopping center, Rinascente, right next to the Duomo. Otherwise, if you’re looking for something a little less glam, Via Torino has more mainstream brands such as H&M and Zara. Those interested in vintage and alternative clothing need look no further than the hip Ticinese area.",

      "content": "This sun-blessed city tops everyone’s destination list, whether it’s for the storybook architecture, glorious food, or simply the lure of a city that’s like a massive beach town. It hits that sweet spot where history and hedonism meet. By day marvel at architectural gems that go from towering Roman-era columns to Gaudí’s masterpieces. By night feast on tasty tapas before hopping to numerous bars and clubs that only get started around 2 am. Best of all, whenever you need a nature break, the beach is right there and waiting. With so much on offer, we make it easier by sharing our top picks. From Gaudí’s spectacular unfinished Sagrada Familia to a museum dedicated to Picasso, we show you the best on offer. Top six things to do in Barcelona 1. Gaze at the Sagrada Familia No visit to Barcelona is complete without visiting Gaudí’s most staggering work. Started in 1812, the sheer magnitude of this project means its construction has continued into the present. Love or hate this twisting turreted masterpiece, there’s nothing quite like it. Head to the Bell Tower for the best views. 2. Visit Casa Batlló With its swirling facade that resembles bony gaping mouths, the Casa Batlló looks like something out of a dream. Commissioned as a home for the well-to-do Batlló family, Gaudí was given full creative licence to create a house like no other. He succeeded – this is Gaudí at his most surreal. 3. Admire masterpieces at the Picasso Museum Focusing mainly on Picasso’s early years, many of which were spent in Barcelona, there’s plenty to capture even casual fans of the artist’s works at this museum. With over 3,500 pieces, Picasso’s versatility becomes quickly apparent, even at the tender age of 15. 4. Explore Park Güell This UNESCO-listed park was originally meant to be a network of houses and landscapes for the rich. Before the project commercially flopped and was finally abandoned, Gaudí created the enchanting park we know today. Explore 3 kilometres of winding pathways, grottoes and mosaicked galleries in Gaudí’s signature style. 5. Find out what Montjuïc has to offer This hilltop overlooking the port is not only packed with lush lawns and tranquil gardens but also top-notch museums, architectural gems, a castle and an Olympic pool. The Joan Miró museum in particular is well worth a visit. It’s also the perfect place to escape the crowds and enjoy sweeping city views. 6. Marvel at La Pedrera Named for its grey stone facade, La Pedrera – or the Quarry – was commissioned as an apartment and office block in 1906. Now it’s recognized as a UNESCO-listed masterpiece in Gaudí’s trademark style. Admire the smoothly curving walls and twisting wrought iron that add a sense of movement and life to the building.",

      "content": "The City That Never Sleeps is where adventurers, three museums in a day-ers, musical lovers, foodies, and shopaholics all meet their match. New York’s history, cuisine, fashion, art, and music have all been nuanced by decades of immigration. So, we’ve made it easier for you by sharing our top picks. From the skyscrapers to world-renowned art museums and the bright lights of Broadway, the Big Apple offers infinite things to see and do. Top 6 things to do in New York City1. Times Square The beating heart of Manhattan, Times Square is one of New York’s most emblematic landmarks. See street performers entertain crowds under the fast-flickering neon lights and bright billboards, go shopping, take selfies or simply watch the world go by from the iconic red steps. Known as ‘The Crossroads of the World’, Times Square is bang in the middle of the Theater District. From long-running classics to modern musicals, seeing a Broadway show is one of the top things to do in New York. 2. Observation Decks Admiring New York City from above is a one-of-a-kind experience. Perched atop towering skyscrapers, the view from one of the city’s observation decks is always breathtaking. Whether you visit the Empire State Building, the Top of the Rock, or The One Vanderbilt SUMMIT in Midtown, the One World Observatory in downtown, or The Edge’s 100th floor observation deck in Hudson Yards, you’re guaranteed a sight to behold. If you really want to go all out, then book a helicopter ride for an incomparable vantage point. For something more grounded, head to one of the city’s rooftop bars. 3. Museums Home to two of the world’s top museums, New York has so much art and culture on display that it would be impossible to cover everything in one trip. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, known as The Met, is a good place to start and houses more than two million pieces of art. Another firm favorite is The Museum of Modern Art, known as the MoMA, which houses a world-class collection of paintings, sculptures, and designs. The American Museum of Natural History is a great choice for families and explores the natural wonders of the world. Or visit the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, which remembers and honors the victims of the attacks on the Twin Towers. 4. Central Park A trip to New York City isn’t complete without visiting Central Park. Escape the city to this urban oasis and see how many landmarks you’ve seen in movies you can spot. Wander around its green meadows, gardens, fountains, ponds, and bridges. Rent a bike to cruise around, visit the Central Park Zoo, admire the view from Belvedere Castle, or join a walking tour to discover John Lennon’s Strawberry Fields, the Bethesda Fountain, Conservatory Garden and much more. 5. Statue of Liberty The Statue of Liberty requires a bit of effort to visit but it’s more than worth it. A gift from France, it’s probably the most famous statue in the world and is undoubtedly New York’s most iconic sight. Representing the freedom and democracy of the United States, it has been standing on Liberty Island since 1886. A 10-to-15-minute ferry ride brings you from Lower Manhattan to the island. While you’re there, don’t miss nearby Ellis Island and its impressive Immigration Museum. 6. Food The melting pot of New York City boasts one of the world’s most diverse culinary scenes. Explore the different flavors and cuisines by joining a gastronomic tour. If you’re looking for authentic Italian food, then head to Arthur Avenue in the Bronx for all the dreamy Italian delicacies you can think of. A foodie tour of the Lower East Side will have you trying mouth-watering specialties such as lox, pastrami, knishes, and pickles from authentic Jewish delis and bakeries. Take a pizza tour to discover your favorite NY slice or head to Chinatown for spicy Asian fare.",

      "content": "Bordeaux is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region and the fifth largest city in France. Located on the Garonne River in southwestern France, Bordeaux is known for being the country's most prominent wine region and is the center of wine-growing and producing. The city was introduced to wine during the mid -first century when Bordeaux was under rule of the Romans. From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux flourished following the marriage of Duchess Eleonore of Aquittance to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, who later became King Henry II of England. After being granted a tax-free trade status with England, many locals benefitted from this and were able to increase their profits trading wine.Bordeaux is also known for its high-spirited university-student population that makes it one of the most vibrant and dynamic cities of France. Called \"La perle d'Aquitaine\" (The Pearl of Aquitaine) and \"La Belle Endormie\" (Sleeping Beauty), Bordeaux barely sleeps offering a smooth lifestyle and an awesome setting. Many festivals are held throughout the year including the Bordeaux river festival and Vinexpo, the world's main wine festival.Half of the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, boulevards became pedestrian-friendly and neoclassical architecture has been restored. Add some world-class architectural buildings, a water-mirror, an exceptional dining scene, an escapade in vineyards and you've almost reached paradise.

      "name": "Venice",
      "code": "venice",
      "content": "Venice is unlike any other place in the world. A city floating on a lagoon, its shimmering canals, glorious marbled palaces and resplendent churches packed with artistic masterpieces will simply take your breath away. Relatively untouched since its glory days as a financial center and maritime power in the 14th century, wandering down an empty street at night is like stepping back in time. For those not sure where to start their exploration of this fairytale-like city, we’ve got you covered. From the awe-inspiring Doge’s Palace to the exquisitely mosaicked Basilica di San Marco, lulling gondola rides and feasts of cicchetti (delicious small local dishes), we show you the best the city has to offer.Top six things to do in Venice1. Doge’s PalaceThe seat of Venetian political power, this waterfront palace is a Gothic masterpiece in white stone and pink marble. It served as both the residence of the Doge and the administrative center. Highlights include lavish council rooms, Tintoretto’s swirling Paradise and a 24-carat gilded stucco staircase.2. St Mark’s SquareThis historic square captures the wealth, beauty and architectural splendor of Venice’s past. Admire famed buildings such as the Basilica di San Marco with its intricate mosaics and marble, along with the arcaded Procuratie Vecchie and Procuratie Nuove. Arrive very early or very late to escape the crowds.3. Gondola rideA gondola ride along the picturesque canals will give you a stunning vantage point on the city. Formerly a mode of transport for the Venetian upper class, now you too can glide down the main canal and hidden waterways (many of which can’t be accessed by foot), while soaking in the unique atmosphere of Venice.4. Cicchetti (local snacks)Don’t leave Venice without stepping into a bacaro (wine bar) and indulging in some cicchetti, the city’s most famous snack. Like the Venetian version of tapas, these are small dishes to be enjoyed at the bar with a glass of ombra (wine), and include everything from polpette (meatballs) to open sandwiches.5. La FeniceOpened in 1792, La Fenice has a long and intriguing history. Not only was it mysteriously set ablaze more than once, but it also premiered the works of several renowned composers, from Verdi to Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. Discover its magic over a heart-rending opera or glimpse its inner workings on a tour.6. Burano and MuranoThere’s more to the lagoon than just Venice. Of the dozen or so inhabited islands, two that are well worth an excursion are Burano and Murano. Each has its own special character. Burano is famed for its pastel-colored canal-side houses while Murano-made glassware has been highly prized since the Middle Ages.Planning your Venice visitWhen to go?Venice’s timeless beauty can be enjoyed all through the year, depending on what you’re looking for. Get a jump on those off-season crowds by coming in spring, but keep in mind the tradeoff will be the certainty of good weather. Summer instead is the city’s peak season and guarantees warm weather, along with higher rates and bigger crowds. September to November is best for those looking to see the city without so many tourists, although you’ll have to watch out for the acqua alta (high tide). Winter gets quite chilly, sights tend to close earlier but it also can be blissfully quiet. That is, except when Carnival comes round, the tourists stream in and the whole city celebrates.How many days should you spend?Around three days will be enough to see all the city’s main attractions and also include some of the neighboring islands, such as Murano or Burano. That said, if you’re looking to enjoy a more local experience, four to five days will give you the chance to wander down some hidden lanes, feast on seafood and soak up the gentle pace of life.How to get there?The closest airport is named after the famed Venetian explorer, Marco Polo. From there it’s a scenic ride by water taxi (from €110) or water shuttle (€22) to central Venice. You can also get there by bus, which is the fastest (20 minutes) and cheapest (€8) option. By taxi it costs around €40. Otherwise you can also fly into Treviso airport, which is used mostly by low-budget airlines. Situated to the north of Venice, it’s an hour-long bus ride (€12 one way) to Piazzale Roma. Taxis cost €80.How to move around the city?It may seem daunting at first getting around this city of winding streets, bridges and canals, but it’s relatively easy once you get the hang of it. Vaporetti are the small passenger ferries that are the city’s main form of public transport. A single ride costs €7.50. If you’re staying for longer or are planning on moving around a lot it might be worth your while investing in a pass; options go from one to seven days and cost €20-60. The ACTV also runs buses that run on the mainland and in Lido. Gondola rides instead are quite pricey (from €80) and are more of an ‘experience’ than a form of transport.Where to shop?Escape the many souvenir shops and you’ll find that while Venice is by no means one of Italy’s shopping mecca’s, it still manages to hold its own. T Fondaco dei Tedeschi by DFS is its most recently hyped locale. A shopping center in a historic building from the 1500s, the building alone is worth a visit, while sweeping views can be enjoyed from the roof. Le Mercerie instead is the city’s classic shopping destination, made up of a warren’s den of streets boasting mostly luxury brands. On Salizada San Moisè, you’ll also find high-end brands, many of which hail from Italy, such as Versace, Miu Miu and Etro. Those looking for something a bit more niche will enjoy exploring the San Samuele area, with its galleries, craft and textile stores and independent boutiques.",

In the souks, you’ll be tempted by basketwork, dried fruits, spices, clothes, wool, skins, Berber carpets, leatherwork, ironwork and jewellery.And don’t forget the desert. At the base of the Atlas Mountains, you’ll find the olive groves of the Menara Gardens and the beautiful Saadian pavilion around a twelfth-century artificial lake. Catch it in the evening as the mountains melt into the sunset. For some real adventure, head out to Ouarzazate via the stunning Tizi n’Tichka pass and experience desert hospitality with the aid of your camel. The Dades and Todra canyons around Erfoud are truly spectacular, and a night spent camping in nomadic tents beneath the stars is one you’ll never forget.",

      "content": "Top 6 things to do in LondonLife moves fast in this sprawling cosmopolitan city. Famed for its diversity, it’s a melting pot of cultures and a hotbed of progressive art, fashion, and music. That said, it’s equally well known for its long and fascinating past that stretches back almost two millennia. This is a place where innovation and the ancient go hand in hand, where you can admire both the historic Tower of London and the modern Shard, or the celebrated British museum and an avantgarde installation. The choices are endless. We make it easier by sharing our top picks with you. From the magnificent Buckingham Palace to an enviable array of world-class museums and a giant wheel with jaw-dropping views, discover the city’s best. 1. Tower of London Dating back to 1066, the Tower of London lets you glimpse the city’s grisly yet captivating past. The former royal residence also served as an armory, treasury, mint, zoo, and most famously a high-ranking prison where royalty and nobles met their tragic ends. You can also admire the glittering Crown Jewels. 2. Buckingham Palace No trip to London is complete without seeing the Buckingham Palace, symbol of the British monarchy and the official royal residence since 1837. While you can admire it from afar, nothing compares to standing before the grandeur of rooms such as the red-carpeted Grand Hall with its glittering chandeliers. 3. London Eye The world’s largest cantilevered observation wheel, the London Eye takes you a dizzying 135m up high. On a clear day, views stretch as far as 25 miles, giving you a birds-eye vantage point on the city’s famed landmarks. It’s a slow 30-minute ride that’s so smooth, it’s easy to forget just how high up you are. 4. British Museum Opened in 1759, the British Museum is one of the world’s oldest and greatest museums, with an awe-inspiring collection of art and artifacts over two million years of human history. From the Rosetta Stone, key to decoding hieroglyphics, to the disputed Elgin Marbles, a visit here is an eye-opening experience. 5. Westminster Abbey If only these walls could speak. Since 960 AD Westminster Abbey has held (almost) every monarch’s coronation since William the Conqueror, 16 royal weddings, and is the resting place of 3300 prominent people in British history, from poets to politicians. It’s also famed for its early English Gothic architecture. 6. National Gallery You could easily spend a day immersed in this collection of European masters with more than 2300 works. Covering the mid-13th century to the 1900s, it has paintings by acclaimed artists ranging from Da Vinci to Van Gogh, Picasso, and Turner. While temporary exhibitions aren’t free, they’re also worth a look. Planning your London visit When to go? London is a bustling megacity that never stops, regardless of the time of year. An action-packed calendar of events, from festivals to live music and theatre performances, takes place all year round. That said, summer is the most popular season for visitors, when the weather gets warm, and the days get long. The downside is you’ll have to endure queues for most attractions, while accommodation prices also rise. Christmas and bank holidays are similarly busy. Spring and autumn are better seasons if you’re looking to avoid the crowds and still enjoy some nicer weather; you may want to pack an umbrella though as it tends to rain. Those who aren’t put off by a bit of cold weather and shorter days will enjoy the calmer winter months of January and February. How many days should you spend? London is the kind of city you can spend anywhere from a day to a week, depending on what you want to get out of your trip and how packed you like your schedule to be. It’s impossible to see everything so it’s best to prioritize and plan in advance. For first-time visitors, three to four days is enough to give you a taste of the city and see some of its main attractions. Keep in mind it’s an enormous city so distances between landmarks can be great; you’ll need to factor this into your plans. Otherwise, five to seven days will allow you to go at a slower pace and include more local experiences, like going to the pub, seeing a play in the West End and strolling through one of its many gorgeous parks. How to get there? Heathrow is the main airport and it’s well connected to central London by bus, the Overground, Heathrow Express and the Tube, which all run from around 5 am to midnight. Night buses are also available, while the Tube runs 24/7 on Friday and Saturday. Tickets cost £5.10-34; taxis costs £50-90. City Airport is closest to central London and is connected by DLR (one way £2.80-5). Taxis cost £25-50. Gatwick is connected by the Gatwick Express that runs direct to Victoria (£31.05). Budget options such as coach (from £4) or bus (£11-20) are also available. Taxis cost around £100. Stansted is connected by the Stansted Express (£19.40) and 24/7 by coach (£8-13). Taxis cost around £100. Luton is accessible by coach 24/7; tickets from £5. Trains cost £17.70; taxis charge £50-80. How to move around the city? London is fairly easy to navigate with an extensive transport system that includes: the Tube (one of the fastest modes of transport), the Overground and the DLR, and buses. Using an Oyster card is the cheapest way to get around. On the other end of the scale, you have taxis, which are convenient but pricey (especially the Black Cabs). The city also has a bike-share program that’s handy if you’re a confident city rider. These are designed for short trips, so if you’re interested in doing a longer journey it’s better to rent a bike elsewhere for the day. If you’re looking for a more scenic way to get around, there are also boat rides along the Thames. Where to shop? London is a paradise without peer for shoppers. If you have the time and money, choices are literally limitless. Oxford is the most famous (and also busiest) of the city’s shopping streets. It’s home to commercial brands such as Adidas and Zara, and a handful of established department stores. Nearby Regent St offers more upscale brands, such as Calvin Klein and Barbour. Covent Garden is also popular, but has a more diverse mix of stores, with luxury brands such as Tom Ford and one-of-a-kind gems such as the Petersham Nurseries and the eclectic Neal’s Yard. Creative types will want to go to Shoreditch, where chic buys from Redchurch Street can be paired with vintage picks from Brick Lane. Finally, Mayfair is the place for haute couture, luxury brands and bespoke suits.",

      "name": "Madrid",
      "code": "madrid",
      "content": "Get caught up in the boundless energy of this magnetic city. Its nightlife is the stuff of legends while its gastronomy is off the charts. Thanks to centuries of art-loving Spanish royals, it also houses several world-class museums with impeccable collections. And while it may not have Barcelona’s famed modernist attractions, it makes up for it with eye-catching architecture that runs the gamut from gracious Belle Époque buildings to Mudéjar Revival churches and medieval mansions. So where to begin when there’s so much on offer? We make it easier with a list of our top picks. From admiring home-grown talents Goya and Velázquez at the Prado to feasting on fantastic tapas, we show you the city’s best. Top 6 things to do in Madrid 1. Museo del Prado Delve into the works of some of Spain’s greatest artists in this world-class museum. Goya, Velázquez and El Greco are all generously represented and offer a window into the country’s past. The museum also has an impressive collection of Flemish, Dutch and Italian art, acquired during the Spanish Empire. 2. Reina Sofía Museum Not just home to Picasso’s famed Guernica, this museum also has an outstanding collection of contemporary art. Along with its many Picassos, you can marvel at a mind-bending Salvador Dalí or boldly colored Joan Miró. It’s also an opportunity to discover some fantastic lesser-known Spanish artists. 3. Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum This extraordinary museum has impressive works from almost every movement of Western art, from 13th-century Italian Gothic to 20th-century pop art. With the personal collection of Swiss industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and his father, you’ll be dazzled by the fantastic breadth of art on show. 4. Royal Palace of Madrid On the former site of a Moor fortress dating back to the 9th century, Felipe V, the first Bourbon King, decided to build a palace more magnificent than all its European counterparts,s. While he died before his vision was complete, the palace is still an immense and opulent masterpiece, well worth a visit. 5. Tapas It would be almost a sin to leave without trying the small dishes for which the country is famed: Spanish tapas. Treat yourself to these bite-sized morsels at any number of bustling bars and markets such as the Mercado de San Miguel. You’ll quickly become addicted to the jamón, tortilla, and patatas bravas. 6. Santiago Bernabéu Stadium Football fanatics will want to visit this temple to their beloved sport, the home also to Real Madrid. A tour lets you glimpse the stadium’s inner workings, from the dressing rooms to the player’s tunnel and even the pitch. A game, instead, gives you the thrill of seeing it come alive with 80,000 screaming fans. Planning your Madrid visit When to go? Spring and Autumn are the best times to visit. The days are still lovely and long and the weather is mild; ideal conditions for strolling around town. In summer instead, the city is flooded by tourists and the heat can be scorching hot. Many locals also leave for a few weeks to go on vacation so some small local shops and cafes will be closed. Come winter (excluding the Christmas and New Year period) and the city gets quiet, which may be perfect for those wanting to avoid the crowds. It can get cold, but the temperatures rarely dip below freezing. Meanwhile, ticket prices and accommodations will be at the lowest, which for some more than make up for a bit of cold. How many days should you spend? Three days will be enough to scratch the surface and get a general feel for the city. If you have the time, five days or more will give you the opportunity to delve deeper and get into the swing of the Madrileño way of life (i.e. late meals, siesta, and of course fiesta!). You’ll be able to wander through Madrid’s charming neighborhoods, go out till all hours enjoying the famed nightlife, sample any number of local delicacies, and even fit in a day trip to Toledo, Segovia, or Ávila. How to get there? The Madrid–Barajas Airport (officially the Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport) is the city’s international airport. It also happens to be the country’s busiest and most impressive. From here it’s an easy train ride to the center. Trains leave every 5 minutes from 6:05 am to 1:30 am; tickets cost €5. Otherwise, you can also take the 24-hour express bus service (€5) or a taxi for a fixed price of €30. How to move around the city? Madrid has an extensive and easy-to-use public transport system. Tickets cost €1.50 for a single trip; a 10-trip ticket costs €12.20 and is a good deal for a short stay. The metro is the most convenient way to get around and runs from 6:05 am to 1:30 am. The bus also comes in handy, but with over 200 routes it’s a tad more complicated for first-time users; it runs from 6:30 am to 11:30 pm. Taxis are relatively easy to find and comparatively cheaper than those in other European capitals. Biking is also an option with several bike-share services and a decent number of central bike lanes. Otherwise, you can walk to most places in central Madrid as it’s fairly compact, although hillier than it seems! Where to shop? This bustling city has no shortage of excellent shopping options that go from luxury to the locally designed. Gran Via is the place for big commercial brands, such as H&M and Zara; it’s also home to the gorgeous outpost of iconic Spanish brand Loewe. Instead, high-flyers will want to head to Calle Serrano, in the expensive Salamanca neighborhood. Here you’ll find high fashion brands, such as Louis Vuitton or Manolo Blahnik, in the most elegant surroundings. Those looking for something more alternative should head to Calle Fuencarral in the hip Malasaña. It has an unusual mix of high-end, street, emerging, and vintage fashion. And don’t forget to make a stop at El Rastro, the city’s lively open-air market.",

      "content": "This freewheeling city is as famous for its vibrant art scene and non-stop clubbing as it is for the powerful sense of history that greets you at every turn. Berlin has been the center of the Prussian Kingdom, the German Empire and the headquarter of the Nazis. It’s revolted, been bombed, divided, and reunited. Now it’s a multicultural hub bursting with start-ups, creative spaces and cultural centers. It’s a city that caters to all tastes, from clubbers to culture vultures and history buffs. With so much to offer, we wanted to share our top picks with you. From the artistic treasures of its Museum Island to its infamous Wall and historic Brandenburg Gate, the city is bound to intrigue and inspire you.Top six things to do in Berlin 1. Museum Island On a small island in the Spree River lies this fascinating museum complex listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Made up of five grand state museums, highlights include the awe-inspiring Ishtar Gate from Babylon on display at the Pergamon Museum, and the renowned bust of Queen Nefertiti at the Neues Museum. 2. Berlin Wall Only fragments remain of this once powerful symbol of the Cold War, the most significant being the Berlin Wall History Mile with its informative panels and the boldly decorated East Side Gallery. The latter showcases the work of over 100 artists, who transformed the grim remains into a monument to freedom. 3. Brandenburg Gate This famed landmark has played an essential role in German history. Taking pride of place in Prussian Berlin, it was later a Cold War symbol of division before becoming the emblem of unification and freedom we know today. Marvel at its history as well as its neoclassical design inspired by Athens’ Acropolis. 4. Reichstag This iconic building has seen its fair share of action. It housed the Imperial Diet until 1933, then was set on fire and fell into disuse, before being restored after German reunification to again house the German parliament. Don’t forget to head to its glossy glass dome for enchanting 360-degree city views. 5. DDR Museum Learn about daily life under the oppressive DDR in this absorbing interactive museum. Not only will you visit a recreated kitchen and a claustrophobic interrogation room, but you’ll also get to go for a virtual spin in a Trabi, the standard car for East Germans often referred to as the ‘worst car ever built’. 6. Boat trip on the SpreeMeandering through the heart of Berlin, the Spree River is one of the city’s most underrated attractions. A riverboat trip offers you an alternative view of some of the capital’s top sights such as the Reichstag, Berlin Cathedral, Museum Island, and even the Fernsehturm TV tower and Neue Synagogue.Planning your Berlin visit When to go? For many, the ideal time to visit Berlin is from May to June and September to October. The weather is pleasantly mild, and you can enjoy sitting in buzzing outdoor cafes and beer gardens, strolling through its many parks, and even going for a breezy bike ride. While this is also possible in July and August, they’re also the busiest months and the wettest (so come prepared with wet gear). For the unaccustomed winter in Berlin can seem uninviting, with grey days and temperatures hovering close to freezing. That said, it can be a good time to find a deal on airfares and hotel rates. How many days should you spend? At a stretch, you might be able to cram the city’s best into one day, but we wouldn’t advise it unless you’re particularly short of time. Three days at a leisurely pace will most likely allow you to scratch the city’s surface, but five days or more will give you a better chance of really getting to know the city. Not only will you be able to see the sights, but you’ll also get to indulge in more local experiences, like a bike ride along the River Spree or a club night in Kreuzberg. How to get there? Berlin Brandenburg opened in October 2020 and is now the city's only airport. The Tegel Airport has permanently closed while the Schönefeld Airport was incorporated into the Brandenburg airport. The easiest way to get from the airport to the city center is by train. To get to Berlin Central station, it takes around 30-35 minutes and costs €3.60 one way. For the same price, you can also take a bus; it will take you around 20 minutes to get to Rudrow metro station. A cab ride from the airport to the center costs around €50. How to move around the city? Berlin has an extensive public transport system, which makes getting around relatively easy. The U-Bahn (subway) is the fastest and most convenient mode of transport. It runs from 4:30 am to 12:30 am Sunday to Thursday, and 24/7 on Fridays and Saturdays. The S-Bahn (light rail) has the same hours but is less frequent and with fewer stops; it’s best used for covering longer distances. Buses tend to be slower and less reliable but also cheaper. They have similar hours to the trains but with the advantage of half-hourly night buses after 12:30 am. Trams are also available but only in the eastern districts. Berlin is also well set up for cycling with many bike lanes and rental shops. Where to shop? The most famous of the city’s shopping streets is without a doubt the Kurfürstendamm (aka ‘Ku’damm’ to locals). Often referred to as the Champs-Élysées of Berlin, this sleek boulevard is packed with high-fashion brands such as Armani, Chanel, and Yves Saint Laurent. Those looking for hip independent boutiques instead should head to Hackescher Markt, an area that brims with old-school Berlin charm. Don’t forget to stop at Hackesche Höfe to admire its Art Nouveau-style courtyards filled with chic shops offering everything from food to fashion. Berlin also loves its many street markets where you’ll discover a treasure trove of pre-loved goods. We recommend the weekend flea markets on Boxhagener Platz and Fehrbelliner Platz.",

The Brandenburg Gate is also a must-see: It once divided the city into two while today it is the symbol of German unity. Art lovers will be happy with a visit to Museum Island and the Kulturforum.

Today, with six million visitors a year, it is the most popular destination among tourists in Eastern Europe. It is not surprising the fact that it boasts of one of the most variegated collections of world architecture, from Art Nouveau to Baroque, from Cubism to Gothic, from Neo-classical to Ultramodern. A tour of the city can only start from the historic center with its narrow streets, a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1992. At its heart is the Old Town Square, surrounded by magnificent buildings, cafes, shops and galleries. Dominating the square are the Gothic spires of the Church of Our Lady before Tyn. Here we also find the Old Town Hall, characterized by colorful Gothic and Renaissance buildings and a tower which offers a picturesque view of the city. At the base of the tower there is a lovely astronomical clock, built in 1400 by master clockmaker Hanus.Founded in the ninth century, the Prague Castle is the national symbol of the Czech Republic, a cultural center and political power for centuries. This mighty monumental complex, consisting of church and residential buildings, fortifications and offices, was originally the residence of princes and kings of Bohemia; since 1918 it has been the seat of the President of the Republic. The area of the castle is dominated by the Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral, the largest and most magnificent church in Prague.Take a stroll in Golden Lane with its picturesque houses, home to alchemists before and goldsmiths later, but also to Franz Kafka, the most illustrious son of Prague and famous writer. Inevitable stop is to admire the romantic Charles Bridge, a stone bridge in the Gothic style that connects the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, commissioned by Charles IV in 1357 and designed by the architect Petr Parler. On the other hand, the symbol of modern Prague is the sinuous Dancing House, designed in the nineties by the architect Frank O. Gehry and inspired by the famous pair of dancers Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.",

Of course, you’ll also take the cable car up Corcovado (the same cable car in which James Bond fought Jaws in Moonraker) and ascend Sugar Loaf Mountain for the views. Up in the hills, the quaint Santa Teresa district and the vibrant favelas present alternative perspectives on Rio life.When the weather gets too hot, flee the traffic and noise to nearby Petropolis – a curious German settlement where the architecture is quite bizarre. For the best views of the city from a distance, we recommend a trip to Gavea Rock high in the mountains above the coast. From here, Sugar Loaf is just a cupcake and the city is a toy.",

More than half of Quang Nam is covered by forests and the Thu Bồn River system. The province is also home to around 15 islands, including the popular Cham Islands. Quang Nam has served as an international trade hub for centuries, commonly exporting luxury goods such as silk, fabrics, paper, porcelain, and more. As a result of this trade, Quang Nam is one of the places where Western influence first entered Vietnam.Top three things to do in Quang NamWander through Hoi An Ancient TownA designated UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999, Hoi An is certainly the most famous tourist attraction in Quang Nam. The city’s well-preserved historic district is picturesque, with a majority of the traditional and colonial buildings painted in a characteristic yellow. We recommend visiting the Chua Cau Temple Bridge (also commonly called the Japanese Bridge) as well as the Hoi An Night Market held in front of it each evening.Seek serenity at the My Son SanctuaryThe My Son Sanctuary is an extensive and unique temple complex that is said to have been the spiritual centre of the ancient Champa empire. While the My Son Sanctuary was bombed during the Vietnam War, the fascinating temple ruins still remain to this day and have been designed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site with great cultural significance.Go for a dip at the Cham IslandsFor those seeking rest and relaxation, the Cham Islands have you covered. This cluster of eight islands is located 16 kilometres from the coast in the East Vietnam Sea. Embark on an excursion to the Cham Islands to lay on one of the pristine beaches or enjoy a variety of water activities such as swimming, snorkeling, diving, boat tours, and more.",

      "content": "The name says it all in Bryce Canyon City. There’s one huge draw here, and that’s Bryce Canyon National Park. Famous for its copper-coloured spires known as hoodoos, this vast gulf is one of the world’s premier geological marvels. Millennia of freezes and thaws have eroded its soft sandstone into a landscape like no other. Evergreen forests give way to sky-scraping spires, rocky ridges and huge, cavernous amphitheatres full of dagger-like stalagmites. What’s more, Bryce’s high altitude gives rise to a series of wow-factor viewpoints from which to admire some of Mother Nature’s finest work. See one of southern Utah’s most impressive national parks and learn the Native American legends that surround the otherworldly hoodoos.Top three things to do in Bryce Canyon City1. Take a hikeAmerica’s national parks are crisscrossed with world-class walking trails, and Bryce Canyon is no exception. Here though, they come with an added touch of magic. The Rim Trail is an easy hike that begins at Bryce Point – a knockout spot overlooking a sea of hoodoos known as Silent City. Further along the route is Sunrise Point which offers great views of Aquarius Plateau and the Sinking Ship, a sloping ridge of sandstone that looks like the stern of a boat, buried in the rock.2. Natural BridgeMother Nature is a fine architect. And this span of dusty, red-hued rock is a prime example. Technically an arch, not a bridge, it’s a testament to the powerful forces at play in Bryce Canyon National Park. Searing hot summers followed by icy winters work to weaken the rock. Then, crumbling and erosion combine to create the incredible windows you see today. The Natural Bridge is one of the park’s must-sees.3. Learn the myths and legends of the hoodoosThese eerie-looking sandstone pinnacles are steeped in Native American myth. Looking like an army of stone warriors standing guard over the park, they’re Bryce’s top attraction. The Paiute Indians have lived in the canyon for centuries and believe the hoodoos are the petrified remains of the Legend People who the trickster god Coyote turned into stone.",

The mineral-rich thermal pools of Pamukkale are a must-see – hot air balloons can even take visitors up for a birds-eye view of this natural phenomenon.

Visit the UNESCO thermal pools of PamukkaleA dreamy landscape of white mineral terraces and staggered pools of turquoise – it’s no surprise this ancient place is known as the ‘cotton castle’. Walk down the milky white cliffs and take in the scenery. Experience the rejuvenating and calming effect of the thermal waters, prized for their healing properties.2. Delve into the past at the HierapolisDiscover the Greco-Roman remains at this UNESCO archaeological site including the Roman Theatre, the Temple of Apollo – with its Devil’s Gate passageway to the underworld – and the Necropolis, one of the best-preserved ancient cemeteries in Turkey. Bring your costumes to bathe in Cleopatra's Antique Pool, an oasis surrounded by palms. 3. Step into nature and enjoy outdoor activities Nature lovers can get their dose of greenery in Denizli City Park, the largest in the city, and the Ornaz Vadisi valley, a local gem. If you head a bit further out of the city, you’ll find Kaklik Cave – known as an ‘underground Pamukkale’ with similar white terraces of thermal pools, but under the surface. It’s a breathtaking spot.",

The whole medina would have once been surrounded by defensive walls, but instead there are sea glimpses all around.Top three things to do in MahdiaSoak up some historyNot much remains of the original Fatimid citadel, but the exception is the Skifa el Kahla gate – also known as Bab Zouila - which is 33 metres high. It has stood here since 916, when it was part of the fortifications surrounding the original town. To enter, you’ll pass through a narrow, vaulted passage almost 50m long.Seek out the catch of the dayMahdia’s fishing port is one of Tunisia’s busiest, so find a spot to settle down and watch the boats come and go. Colourful boats sitting in the dry dock and fishing nets being repaired are all part of the picture. The harbour area is a good place to find fresh fish and seafood at the restaurants nearby.Watch weavers at workThe traditional dress of Mahdia is Tunisia’s most elaborate, and even now the town is known for its skilled weavers and quality fabrics spun through with gold thread. As you wander the lanes of the medina, you’ll see weaver’s workshops with old-fashioned looms where these fine textiles are made by hand.",

Island hopping on Longtail Boats\nSail across the islands on traditional boats visiting the best snorkelling spots, Monkey Bay’s crab-eating monkeys, blacktip reef sharks and Shark Pint and the cove-like canyon of Pileh Lagoon. Watch the sunset on afternoon tours with the chance to see bioluminescent plankton lighting up the waters at night. 2. Explore Maya Bay on Phi Phi Leh\nYou might know this sandy stretch from the film ‘The Beach’. While you might not see Leonardo DiCaprio this time round, you'll get to see towering limestone cliffs, powdery white sands and emerald waters. If it’s got the Hollywood seal of approval – it’s got ours too. 3. Hike to the Phi Phi Viewpoint on Phi Phi Don\nEmbark on a scenic hike for a panoramic spectacle of the entire archipelago. Snap up pics of the twin bays, Tonsai Village, Phi Phi Leh and the surrounding cliffs.
